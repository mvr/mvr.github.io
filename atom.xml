<p>The code in the <a href="/posts/no-three-in-line.html">previous post</a> is
fairly quick, but of course we’d always prefer it to be quicker. I’ll
keep a record here of things I’ve tried and whether they worked.

<h3 id="one-hop-cells">One-hop Cells</h3>
<p>After a bit more thinking, I realised there’s a class of lines through
a point that can be handled all at once rather than one at a time.</p>
<p>We saw in the last post that relatively-prime endpoints that are far
away from each other can be skipped, when an additional point in
either direction would be off the edge of the grid. What about points
a little closer than that, where it’s possible the next point on the
line is still in bounds?</p>

<p>One way to describe the location of that in-bounds cell is that we’ve
taken the upper endpoint and reflected it through the lower endpoint.
Now here’s the trick: if we fix the lower point, we can determine
these one-hop cells for a whole collection of upper endpoints
simultaneously by reflecting the whole board through the lower
endpoint:</p>

<p>This is fast to do, because it’s just a bit-reverse to deal with the
horizontal reflection and a shuffle to deal with the vertical
reflection.</p>
<p>For some offsets, these one-hop points are the only possible
additional points on the line, so we can remove those offsets from the
mask of “relevant” ones that need the fully general treatment. The new
mask for <span class="math inline">13 \times 13</span> looks as follows: the thing to notice is that
the solid square in the middle is smaller than it was before:</p>

<p>We’ve decreased the proportion of expensive pairs from 304/625
down to 256/625.</p>
<h3 id="soft-branching">Soft Branching</h3>
<p>An idea we can use from <a href="https://gitlab.com/apgoucher/silk">Silk</a> is
to do more work in each node by “soft branching” on the values in a
cell, or along a row or column. This means speculatively setting the
value of a cell either way, propagating information, and finally
taking the intersection of everything learned in the two branches.
It’s fairly often the case that either value of a particular unknown
cell ultimately forces some other cell to be empty regardless of which
option we take, so we do increase the information learned overall even
if neither branch directly leads to a contradiction. Here’s a simple
though slightly contrived example:</p>
<div class="lifeviewer"><textarea>
x = 14, y = 14, rule = LifeHistory
14B$3BD10B$3BD10B$3BD10B$14B$3BDA9B$3BD10B$3BD2BD7B$3BD10B$3BDA9B$14B

<p>Regardless of where the two points in the nearly-full column end up
being, at least one of them is going to eliminate the point out to the
right.</p>
<p>Doing this check for every cell would be far too expensive so, we need
a heuristic for what it’s worth soft branching on. A natural choice is
to soft branch on the vulnerable cells one-by-one. This does, at
times, make a lot of extra progress at each node without requiring any
additional interaction with the queue, but unfortunately this ends up
being a little slower overall. Maybe there’s a better heuristic for
cells that it’s <em>really</em> worth soft branching on, but I don’t have any
ideas for this.</p>
<h3 id="saturating-2-bit-counter">Saturating 2-Bit Counter</h3>
<p>We get a lot of mileage out of forcing cells whose value is implied by
the counts of existing values in their row or column. To count
vertically along each column, we use a binary counter and reduce
across a warp.</p>
<p>As it stands, this counter has two bits <code>bit0</code> and <code>bit1</code> and an
<code>overflow</code> bit, so the counter can store a state in <span class="math inline">\{0, 1, 2, 3,
{\gt}3\}</span>. But, in fact, we never need to know we have a count of <span class="math inline">3</span>
exactly, so we can pack the information into two bits <code>bit0</code> and
<code>bit1</code> with <code>bit0 &amp; bit1</code> now representing <span class="math inline">{\gt}2</span>.</p>
<p>We might worry that the bit manipulation for combining two such
counters gets more complicated, but we win here too.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode cpp"><code class="sourceCode cpp"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="dt">uint32_t</span> bit0 <span class="op">=</span> </span>

<p>Calculating the new <code>bit1</code> should be clear: the result is <span class="math inline">{\geq}2</span>
whenever the inputs are <span class="math inline">{\geq}2</span>, or when we are calculating <span class="math inline">1 + 1</span>.
The expression for <code>bit0</code> is less obvious but can be brute forced.
There are only 4 cases where the output <code>bit0</code> is 0, i.e. <span class="math inline">0 + 0</span>,
<span class="math inline">1 + 1</span>, <span class="math inline">2 + 0</span> and <span class="math inline">0 + 2</span>, and the expression above covers all the
other cases.</p>
<p>By some miracle, the first line for <code>bit0</code> is calculating the <em>bitwise
majority</em> of the values <code>x.bit1</code>, <code>y.bit0</code> and <code>y.bit1</code>, and this can
be done using a single <code>LOP3.LUT</code> instruction. (Unfortunately the
compiler doesn’t realise this itself, so we have to write it
manually.)</p>

<p>In all, this should compile to just 4 instructions. This calculation
for a “saturating” 2-bit counter is surely known, but I didn’t find it
after a little Googling. Using this simpler counter was about a 10%
speed improvement.</p>
<h3 id="alternating-forcing-axis">Alternating Forcing Axis</h3>
<p>Forcing along orthogonal lines is an idempotent operation along each
axis; once we’ve checked the counts horizontally and forced cells
accordingly, it’s impossible for that to reveal more horizontal counts
that cause cells to be forced. It’s only when alternating the
horizontal and vertical checks that we make progress.</p>
<p>Currently we do a horizontal round and a vertical round, and repeat
this process if it has resulted in any changes from where we started.
It seems like we might get a nice speed improvement by keeping track
specifically of which axis has caused changes, and avoiding a
pointless vertical round if the previous horizontal round didn’t
change anything.</p>
<p>To my surprise, this is actually slightly slower than always doing a
horizontal round followed by a vertical round in pairs. I find it hard
to explain why this might be; something for future investigation I
suppose.</p>
<h3 id="finding-a-bit">Finding a Bit</h3>
<p>Something a little unexpected is that each use of the <code>__ffs</code>
intrinsic gets compiled to a pair of instructions like</p>
<pre><code>    BREV R30, R30
    FLO.U32.SH R33, R30</code></pre>
<p>That is, it bit-reverses the value and then finds the leading set bit,
presumably because the underlying hardware does not have an
instruction equivalent to <code>__ffs</code>.</p>
<p>The two instructions above have pretty bad throughput. In most places
<code>__ffs</code> appears, it’s not actually important to find the lowest set
bit; we just need to find <em>some</em> set bit. Switching to <code>31 - __clz(x)</code>
gets rid of the <code>BREV</code> step and so ends up slightly faster overall.</p>
<h3 id="factors">2-Factors</h3>
<p>It would be nice to have at quick test for whether it’s possible to
complete the configuration considering only the orthogonal
constraints. There’s a reformulation of this problem. Define a
bipartite graph where one set of vertices represents the rows and the
other the columns. Each edge is then a cell of the grid, and we’ll
only include edges where that cell of the grid has not yet been ruled
out. A completed grid is then a spanning subgraph where every node has
degree two, that is, a 2-factor. This means that the graph is
partitioned into a set of disjoint loops (a structural feature of the
problem that perhaps should have been obvious from the start).</p>
<p>In terms of the original grid, you can choose a point and trace out
the corresponding loop by moving to the partner of that point in the
same row or column, alternating each time so you make progress.
Sometimes there’s only one loop, but not necessarily:</p>

<p>So, what would be nice is a way to quickly check whether the graph for
the remaining cells admits a 2-factor. And surprisingly (to me), this
can be done in polynomial time.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-0" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-0" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">In contrast to the similar problem of
finding Hamiltonian cycles, which is NP-complete.<br />
<br />
</span></span> I was feeling
awfully clever at this point, but some simple tests show that only
around 1/1000 configurations in the search tree would be eliminated by
this check, and so it’s not remotely worth doing.</p>
<!-- Once we have a 2-factor, it would be nice to know if any of the edges -->

<p>If we in addition consider the lines with slope <span class="math inline">\pm 1</span>, our hit rate
for ruling out configurations early is 1/3, which is much more
promising. Adding these constraints gets us back into the <a href="https://jair.org/index.php/jair/article/view/11079">land of
NP-completeness</a>
(probably). Still: it may be worth doing a per-node lookahead of this
simpler kind, something I’ll look into.</p>
<h3 id="literature-search">Literature Search</h3>
<p>This problem of filling a grid in a way that matches the orthogonal
constraints is reminiscent of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonogram">Nonograms</a>. The difference is
that for Nonograms, one is told the specific runs of points, rather
than a total count. I looked at some Nonogram solvers, but they
don’t seem to hold any tricks that will help here.</p>
<p>Our problem is much closer to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_tomography">Discrete
Tomography</a>, the
study of reconstructing binary images from their projections. In our
case the projections are always the same; the thing that makes our
problems distinct is that certain entries of the image are forced to
be empty in advance. There are a couple of papers in this direction
that focus on special cases, but nothing too useful.</p>

<h3 id="cuda-wrangling">CUDA Wrangling</h3>
<p>One head-slapper was that I was compiling for Compute Capability 8.6
whereas my hardware has Compute Capability 8.7. This was another 10%
improvement for free. Specifying <code>__launch_bounds__</code> to ensure
maximum occupancy also helped a little, though not as much as I hoped.</p>
<p>One wrinkle I haven’t been able to smooth out is that the compiled
code is littered with <code>BRA.DIV</code> instructions, guarding against the
possibility that threads in the warp have diverged. This never
actually happens when the code is run, but I haven’t been able to
convince the compiler of this. Besides wasting a little time, I’m
worried that those instructions are blocking the compiler from
performing additional optimisations.</p>

<p>There is a <a href="https://wwwhomes.uni-bielefeld.de/achim/no3in/effort.txt">mysterious
table</a> on
Flammenkamp’s website giving the “relative effort” of generating all
solutions for different size of grid, which seems to suggest that
<span class="math inline">16\times 16</span> should be easier than <span class="math inline">15\times 15</span>. If this is so, I

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-three-in-line_problem">No-three-in-line
problem</a> asks
how many points can be placed on a <span class="math inline">n \times n</span> grid so that no three
points are on the same line, where the lines considered are of any
slope and not just orthogonal and diagonal. Each row/column can
contain at most 2 points, so clearly the answer is at most <span class="math inline">2n</span>. The
real question is, can we actually achieve <span class="math inline">2n</span> for every grid size?
It’s <a href="https://doi.org/10.4153%2FCMB-1968-062-3">conjectured</a> that the
answer is “no” for grids large enough, but we don’t know where the
crossover point is and there’s <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20131027174807/http://wso.williams.edu/~bchaffin/no_three_in_line/index.htm">no
indication</a>
that the number of <span class="math inline">2n</span>-point solutions is falling away from
exponential growth, at least up to <span class="math inline">18 \times 18</span>!</p>
<p>To my eye, the configurations that work can be quite balanced and
attractive. Here are some symmetrical ones for <span class="math inline">14 \times 14</span> (though
in general the solutions are not necessarily symmetric in this way):</p>

<p>The most extensive searches for configurations so far have been done
by <a href="http://wwwhomes.uni-bielefeld.de/achim/no3in/readme.html">Achim
Flammenkamp</a>
and later by <a href="https://benchaffin.com/">Ben Chaffin</a>. I’ve <a href="https://github.com/mvr/no-three-in-line">written
some CUDA code</a><span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-0" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-0" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">By the way,
the existing <code>cuda-mode</code> for Emacs is a bit messed up, I have a fork
with some bugfixes <a href="https://github.com/mvr/cuda-mode">here</a>.<br />
<br />
</span></span> of my
own with the goal of pushing things a little further, and I’ll explain
it in the rest of this post.</p>
<!--more-->
<h2 id="general-strategy">General Strategy</h2>
<p>We’ll be doing a simple depth-first search over configurations,
storing a stack in device memory that the CUDA kernel interacts with.
Each configuration consists of two bitboards: one for cells known to
contain a point and another for cells known to be empty. On each
search step, we’ll propagate as much information as we can in the
given configuration. If we don’t reach a contradiction, we’ll use a
heuristic to choose a row or column, and branch on all possibilities
for the locations of the points in that row.</p>
<p>To avoid repeating work, we’ll also check that the configuration is in
a canonical orientation. Here, that means it’s lexicographically
earliest out of all members in its symmetry orbit. If not, we just
discard the configuration. Doing this check accurately is slightly
less straightforward than it sounds, because of cells whose state is
still unknown.</p>
<p>As we did<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Or rather, as APG
<a href="https://gitlab.com/apgoucher/lifelib/-/blob/master/cuda2/cudagol.h">did</a>.<br />
<br />
</span></span>
when representing <a href="/posts/cool-still-lifes.html">Game of Life
configurations</a> on the GPU, we’re going
to be representing a <span class="math inline">32 \times 32</span> board by storing a single
<code>uint32_t</code> per thread, each representing a single row. Across the 32
threads in a warp (which we might imagine stacked vertically), these
values represent the whole board.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-2" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">In this problem we’ll only be using
a <span class="math inline">n \times n</span> subset of the full <span class="math inline">32 \times 32</span> board available, but
trying to be more lane-efficient here would be hugely complex for
almost no gain.<br />
<br />
</span></span> There are a handful of warp-level primitives that
make manipulating such boards easy. We just have to make sure that
execution stays synchronised across the warp at all times or it will
hang.</p>
<p>For example, we can test whether a board is empty by checking whether
all rows are empty, using a ballot:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode cpp"><code class="sourceCode cpp"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="dt">bool</span> empty <span class="op">=</span> __ballot_sync<span class="op">(</span><span class="bn">0xffffffff</span><span class="op">,</span> state<span class="op">)</span> <span class="op">==</span> <span class="dv">0</span><span class="op">;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>And we can find the first set bit in a board by doing a ballot to
find the first nonempty row, and then using a shuffle to broadcast the
position in that row to all the other threads.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode cpp"><code class="sourceCode cpp"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="dt">unsigned</span> x <span class="op">=</span> __ffs<span class="op">(</span>state<span class="op">)</span> <span class="op">-</span> <span class="dv">1</span><span class="op">;</span></span>

<h2 id="propagating-orthogonally">Propagating Orthogonally</h2>
<p>The simplest information propagation we’ll be doing is setting forced
values in each row and column. This can be done in two complementary
situations:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the row/column contains <span class="math inline">2</span> known points already, the rest of the
row must be empty.</li>
<li>If the row/column contains <span class="math inline">n-2</span> known empty cells, the two
remaining cells must contain points.</li>
</ul>
<p>For rows, this is straightforward. Each thread can use the <code>__popc</code>
primitive to count the number of points in its row directly. Columns
are more expensive, because we need to count across threads.</p>
<p>A small binary counter is enough: we use two bits to count <span class="math inline">0,1,2,3</span>,
and another bit to record overflow for any count higher than that. We
can then tree-reduce the binary counter across the warp, to do 5
rounds of additions rather than 32. Each “bit” here is actually
represented again as a <code>uint32_t</code>, considering that 32-bit value as a
bit-vector with one position for each column. We have to do two binary
counts: one to count the known points (and force accordingly), and one
to count the not-known-empty cells (and force accordingly).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we can’t force values based on lines of other slopes:
there’s no requirement for these lines to contain exactly two points
each. In principle this kind of counting could still be useful though.
For example, each diagonal line can contain at most two points, so if
we tally up the number of available positions on each diagonal,
clamped at a maximum of 2 per line, we might be able to determine
early that a position is not completable even if each row and column
individually looks alright.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-3" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-3" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">There are <span class="math inline">2n-1</span> diagonal lines
in each direction compared with <span class="math inline">n</span> orthogonal lines, so a lot more
“room” to fit points in.<br />
<br />
</span></span> But after some experiments, it seems doing
this check is not a time improvement.</p>
<h2 id="eliminating-lines">Eliminating Lines</h2>
<p>The above handles orthogonal lines, but we also have to update the
known-empty cells caused by lines of all other slopes. I couldn’t come
up with an efficient way to do this simultaneously for all points, as
we did for the orthogonal lines<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-4" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-4" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">But maybe there’s a better way to do
it, please let me know!<br />
<br />
</span></span>. For each new point, we handle the lines
through all other points one by one.</p>
<p>So let’s suppose two points <span class="math inline">p = (p_0, p_1)</span>, <span class="math inline">q = (q_0, q_1)</span>, and
let’s say that <span class="math inline">p</span> is above <span class="math inline">q</span>, so <span class="math inline">p_1 &lt; q_1</span><span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-5" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-5" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">We’ve already handled
the case where two points are in the same row.<br />
<br />
</span></span>. The first step is to
bring <span class="math inline">q</span> as close as possible to <span class="math inline">p</span> on the same line, because we
don’t want to accidentally miss the points <em>between</em> <span class="math inline">p</span> and <span class="math inline">q</span>:</p>

<p>That is, we scale <span class="math inline">\Delta = (q_0-p_0, q_1-p_1)</span> down by <span class="math inline">\gcd(q_0-p_0,
q_1-p_1)</span>. We can avoid doing this expensive calculation for each line
by precomputing a table of <span class="math inline">x / \gcd(x, y)</span> for all <span class="math inline">0 \leq x,y &lt; n</span>
and storing it in the device’s constant memory, which is pretty quick
to read.</p>
<p>So far the same calculation has been done in all threads. Now, each
thread checks whether its row contains a point on the line<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-6" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-6" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Again, by
assumption the line is not horizontal, so at most one point in each
row is on the line.<br />
<br />
</span></span>. Not all rows will, because for some rows the
line falls between integer points (as in the example above). If the
row does contain a point, a little algebra gives us which bit needs to
be set. It doesn’t seem possible to avoid integer division/modulus
here, unfortunately.</p>

<p>There are a couple of ways to speed this up. First, we can avoid the
integer divisions completely in the case that <code>delta.second</code> is a
power of two. Rather than writing out special cases by hand, we can
give the compiler some strong encouragement to do it for us:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre class="sourceCode cpp"><code class="sourceCode cpp"><span id="cb4-1"><a href="#cb4-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="cf">switch</span> <span class="op">(</span>delta<span class="op">.</span>second<span class="op">)</span> <span class="op">{</span></span>

<p>Second, we can do some early filtering on the pairs of points that we
need to consider. If <span class="math inline">\Delta</span> is large enough then additional points
in either direction will be off the edge of the grid, so we can skip
processing that line entirely. This applies so long as there are no
points between, which is again determined by calculating the GCD of
the coordinates of <span class="math inline">\Delta</span>.</p>

<p>For this, we precompute a mask giving all “relevant” endpoints for a

use this mask (appropriately shifted) to restrict to the second

<p>So only 304/625 of the time do we need to actually process a pair of
points.</p>
<h2 id="branching-and-vulnerable-cells">Branching and Vulnerable Cells</h2>
<p>The remaining piece of the puzzle is how we choose what to branch on
once we’ve propagated all the information we can. One observation is
that for the typical cell, placing a point in that cell provides a lot
more information than assuming the cell is empty. If it contains a
point, the lines through that point are likely to rule out a handful
of other cells, whereas if empty, we’ve learned very little.</p>
<p>But for some unknown cells, learning that cell is empty causes a
<em>different</em> cell to contain a point, via the orthogonal forcing
detailed earlier. This happens when a row/column has zero points and
three unknowns, or when a row/column has one point already and two
unknowns. These cells I’m calling “vulnerable”, and they’re more
promising to branch on.</p>
<p>Here’s the best strategy I’ve been able to come up with, just fiddling
with some different options:</p>
<ul>
<li>If there are any vulnerable cells, choose the one closest to the
centre of the board and branch on whether it contains a point.</li>
<li>Otherwise, find the row (not column!) with the fewest options for
where its points can go and branch on each possibility.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m not sure why preferring to always branch along the same axis works
much better than, say, always taking the row or column with fewest
unknown cells, but empirically it’s the case. This makes me think
there’s a lot about the structure of this search problem that I don’t
understand.</p>
<p>Again for the curious, here are some typical mid-search
configurations, where the red cells are ones which have been
definitively ruled out. Is there an obvious “tell” for these that
makes clear they’re not completable? I don’t see one.</p>

<p>I want to take this and run with it: let’s see what it looks like to
define some mixed linear/nonlinear functions in a linear/nonlinear
type theory. This feels to me so obvious that it must be written down
somewhere already. In the literature there is work that gets close
(and I’ll do some comparisons at the end), but none are quite what I
want. Please let me know if I’ve missed something.</p>

<h2 id="the-setting">The Setting</h2>
<p>To be totally explicit, what we want to capture is:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\mathrm{Set}</span> is cartesian closed with finite coproducts,</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\mathrm{Vec}_{\mathbb{R}}</span> is symmetric monoidal closed with finite biproducts.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\mathrm{Vec}_{\mathbb{R}}</span> is powered and copowered over
<span class="math inline">\mathrm{Set}</span>, and in particular there is a lax monoidal adjunction given by
<span class="math display">\begin{align*}
\mathsf{F}- &amp;:\equiv- \odot \mathbb{R} \\
\mathrm{U}- &amp;:\equiv\mathrm{Vec}_{\mathbb{R}}(\mathbb{R}, -)
\end{align*}</span>
(and <span class="math inline">\mathsf{F}</span> is automatically also strong monoidal by “doctrinal
adjunction”).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="judgements">Judgements</h3>
<p>There are different presentations of the logic, some which merge the
<span class="math inline">\mathcal{L}</span> and <span class="math inline">\mathcal{C}</span> rules. I want to keep things separated
to avoid (my own) confusion. So we have two term judgements, one
cartesian and one linear.</p>
<p><span class="math display">
\Gamma \vdash x : X \qquad \qquad
\Gamma \mid \Lambda \vdash a :: A
</span></p>
<p>The context of the linear judgement has two “zones”, with a term such
as the above interpreted as a morphism <span class="math inline">a : \mathsf{F}\Gamma \otimes
\Lambda \to A</span>. We don’t need “bunches” in the sense of bunched
logics, because bunching only arises when <span class="math inline">\to</span> and <span class="math inline">\multimap</span> exist on
the same mode/category, which is not the case here.</p>
<p>I’ll be consistent about using serif and <span class="math inline">:</span> for nonlinear
definitions, and sans-serif and <span class="math inline">::</span> for linear definitions.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-0" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-0" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Because
linear is bouba and non-linear is kiki.<br />
<br />

<p>I will use <span class="math inline">ℝ</span> to refer to the monoidal unit, although nothing in this
post really requires it to be the real numbers as opposed to an
arbitrary ring. The syntax for the introduction rule <span class="math inline">\mathsf{e}:: ℝ</span> is
chosen so that we think of <span class="math inline">\mathsf{e}</span> as an “abstract basis vector”. It
is tempting to use <span class="math inline">1</span> here, but <span class="math inline">1</span> looks more like a constant which
can be dropped into any term in any location, which is certainly not
the case for <span class="math inline">\mathsf{e}</span>.</p>
<p>In most places, I’m going to write functions that involve these
eliminators using pattern matching notation rather than mentioning the
eliminators explicitly. Sue me!</p>
<h3 id="power-copower-and-hom-set">Power, Copower and Hom-set</h3>
<p>Our first departure from the ordinary presentation of LNL is to
generalise the <span class="math inline">\mathsf{F}</span> and <span class="math inline">\mathrm{U}</span> adjunction to the copower and
“external” hom adjunction</p>
<p>First the copower, a kind of mixed pairing of a nonlinear and linear
type.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">This kind of mixed paring isn’t novel, a dependent version of
this was used in the <span class="math inline">LNL_D</span> theory of Krishnaswami, Pradic and Benton
(cited below).<br />

<p>From the above operations we can derive the functors <span class="math inline">\mathsf{F}</span> and
<span class="math inline">\mathrm{U}</span> exactly as suggested earlier: <span class="math inline">\mathsf{F}:\equiv- \odot
\mathbb{R}</span> and <span class="math inline">\mathrm{U}:\equiv\mathrm{Vec}_{\mathbb{R}}(\mathbb{R}, -)</span>. The derived
rules are slightly different to what you see in other presentations of
LNL, but I think it will help to be explicit about what’s happening to
the unit type <span class="math inline">ℝ</span> involved in both of these constructions.</p>
<!-- I'll change the rules slightly compared to other versions of LNL, and -->
<!-- build in a substitution for the unit in the introduction rule. This -->
<!-- avoids a weird context in the conclusion, and I think looks pretty -->
<!-- nice: *of course* you should be allowed to scale the basis vector when -->
<!-- describing an element of $\adjF X$. The $\beta$-rule ends up worse, because -->
<!-- that scaling now has to occur. -->
<!-- ```mathpar -->
<!-- \inferrule*{\Gamma \mid \Lambda \yields \alpha :: \mathbb{R} \and \Gamma \yields n : X} -->
<!--     {\Gamma \mid \Lambda \yields \alpha \mathsf{e}_n :: \adjF X} \and -->
<!-- \inferrule*{\Gamma, x : X \mid \Lambda \yields c :: C \\\\ \Gamma \mid \Lambda' \yields p :: \adjF X}{\Gamma \mid \Lambda, \Lambda' \yields \ind{p}{\mathsf{e}_x}{c} :: C} -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- From this we can derive the "underlying set" operation $\adjU $ (also building -->
<!-- in an instance of unit elimination): -->
<!-- ```mathpar -->
<!-- \inferrule*{\Gamma \mid \cdot \yields a :: A} -->
<!--     {\Gamma \yields \partial.a : \adjU A} \and -->
<!-- \inferrule*{\Gamma \yields u : \adjU A \and \Gamma \mid \Lambda \yields r :: \mathbb{R}} -->
<!--     {\Gamma \mid \Lambda \yields u(r) :: A} -->
<!-- ``` -->
<p>For the other right adjoint, if we transpose the nonlinear side of
<span class="math inline">\odot</span> we get the power <span class="math inline">X \pitchfork B</span>. This is the <em>linear</em> type
given by the <span class="math inline">X</span>-fold product of <span class="math inline">B</span> with itself.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-4" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-4" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Where does this
pitchfork notation come from originally?<br />

to have all of these as independent type formers, though you could
define some of them in terms of the others, like <span class="math inline">\mathrm{Vec}_{\mathbb{R}}(A, B) \cong
\mathrm{U}(A \multimap B)</span>.<br />

<p>Accordingly, there are four different ways a variable can be bound:
one for each function type. To help distinguish, I’ve used <span class="math inline">\lambda x</span>
when binding a nonlinear variable, so for <span class="math inline">\to</span> and <span class="math inline">\pitchfork</span>, and
<span class="math inline">\partial a</span> when binding a linear variable, so for <span class="math inline">\multimap</span> and
<span class="math inline">\mathrm{Vec}(-,-)</span>.</p>
<h3 id="boolean">Boolean</h3>
<p>We’ll need to be able to eliminate nonlinear inductive types into the
linear term judgement.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-6" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-6" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">In Mike’s terminology this is asking that the
mode morphism from nonlinear types into linear ones is “transparent”.
(I think.)<br />
<br />
</span></span> This should be derivable because <span class="math inline">\mathsf{F}</span> is a left
adjoint, but it’s convenient to just have it as a rule. For example,
for <span class="math inline">\mathrm{Bool}</span>:</p>
<div class="figure">

    \Gamma \mid \Lambda \yields a_t :: A \and 
    \Gamma \mid \Lambda \yields a_f :: A }

<p>This kind of nonlinear interaction is a change in perspective compared

linear type formers.</p>

<p>We could also put in additive coproducts, but we’re not going to need them.</p>
<h3 id="global-additivity">Global Additivity</h3>
<p>This is the other feature that goes beyond the original LNL logic: we
add in global “additivity” rules for <em>all</em> linear types. This will
turn the products we just put in above into biproducts.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-7" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-7" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">And note also
that “addition is additive”, in that the linear context is not split
into two pieces by the <span class="math inline">+</span> rule.<br />

<p>I’m thinking of these equations as directed, so we prefer to rewrite
the left sides into the right sides. (I may be missing some…)</p>
<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>
<p>Now let’s run the experiment. What does it feel like to write down
some basic definitions in this thing?</p>
<h3 id="monoidality-and-functoriality">Monoidality and Functoriality</h3>
<p>Let’s check quickly that we get out what we think we put in. Remembering that <span class="math inline">\mathsf{F}X</span> and <span class="math inline">\mathrm{U}A</span> are shorthand for <span class="math inline">X \odot ℝ</span> and <span class="math inline">\mathrm{Vec}_{\mathbb{R}}(ℝ, A)</span> respectively:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\begin{align*}
&amp;\mathsf{mon}_\mathsf{F}:: \mathsf{F}X \otimes \mathsf{F}Y \multimap\mathsf{F}(X \times Y) \\
&amp;\mathsf{mon}_\mathsf{F}((x \odot \mathsf{e}) \otimes (y \odot \mathsf{e})) :\equiv(x, y) \odot \mathsf{e}\\
~\\
&amp;\mathsf{mon}_\mathsf{F}^{-1} :: \mathsf{F}(X \times Y) \multimap\mathsf{F}X \otimes \mathsf{F}Y \\
&amp;\mathsf{mon}_\mathsf{F}^{-1}((x, y) \odot \mathsf{e}) :\equiv(x \odot \mathsf{e}) \otimes (y \odot \mathsf{e}) \\
~\\
&amp;\mathrm{mon}_\mathrm{U}: \mathrm{U}A \times \mathrm{U}B \to \mathrm{U}(A \otimes B)\\
&amp;\mathrm{mon}_\mathrm{U}(a, b)(\mathsf{e}) :\equiv a(\mathsf{e}) \otimes b(\mathsf{e}) \\
\end{align*}</span></p>
<p>(Or in <span class="math inline">\mathrm{mon}_\mathrm{U}</span> we could not pattern match on the unit and
use the argument on one of the sides.)</p>
<p>It’s similarly straightforward to show that all our type formers are
functorial. For purely linear or nonlinear type formers it goes
exactly as normal, so I’ll just demonstrate the ones that involve both
linear and nonlinear types.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\begin{align*}
&amp;\mathsf{func}_\odot :: \mathsf{F}(X \to Y) \multimap(A \multimap B) \multimap(X \odot A \multimap Y \odot B) \\
&amp;\mathsf{func}_\odot(f \odot \mathsf{e})(h)(x \odot a) :\equiv f(x) \odot h(a) \\
~\\
&amp;\mathsf{func}_\pitchfork :: \mathsf{F}(Y \to X) \multimap(A \multimap B) \multimap(X \pitchfork A \multimap Y \pitchfork B) \\
&amp;\mathsf{func}_\pitchfork(f \odot \mathsf{e})(h)(p)(y) :\equiv h(p(f(y))) \\
~\\
&amp;\mathrm{func}_{\mathrm{Vec}_{\mathbb{R}}} : \mathrm{Vec}_{\mathbb{R}}(D, C) \to \mathrm{Vec}_{\mathbb{R}}(A, B) \to (\mathrm{Vec}_{\mathbb{R}}(C, A) \to \mathrm{Vec}_{\mathbb{R}}(D, B)) \\
&amp;\mathrm{func}_{\mathrm{Vec}_{\mathbb{R}}} (h, g, f)(d) :\equiv g(f(h(d)))
\end{align*}</span></p>
<p>The definitions for <span class="math inline">\odot</span> and <span class="math inline">\mathrm{Vec}_{\mathbb{R}}</span> specialise to <span class="math inline">\mathsf{F}</span> and
<span class="math inline">\mathrm{U}</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\begin{align*}
&amp;\mathsf{func}_\mathsf{F}:: \mathsf{F}(X \to Y) \multimap(\mathsf{F}X \multimap\mathsf{F}Y) \\
&amp;\mathsf{func}_\mathsf{F}(f \odot \mathsf{e})(x \odot r) :\equiv f(x) \odot r \\
~\\
&amp;\mathrm{func}_\mathrm{U}: \mathrm{Vec}_{\mathbb{R}}(A, B) \to (\mathrm{U}A \to \mathrm{U}B) \\
&amp;\mathrm{func}_\mathrm{U}(h, a)(r) :\equiv h(a(r))
\end{align*}</span></p>
<p>Interestingly, there’s a different kind of functoriality for
<span class="math inline">\pitchfork</span>: nonlinear functoriality on the underlying sets. This is
a genuinely different construction to the above, not just its image
under some bijection, because the provided function could nonlinearly
scramble all the elements of <span class="math inline">\mathrm{U}A</span>.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-8" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-8" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">What a mess!<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\begin{align*}
&amp;\mathrm{func}_\pitchfork : (Y \to X) \to (\mathrm{U}A \to \mathrm{U}B) \to \mathrm{U}(X \pitchfork A) \to \mathrm{U}(Y \pitchfork B) \\
&amp;\mathrm{func}_\pitchfork(f, g, u)(r)(y) :\equiv g(\partial r&#39;. u(r&#39;)(f(y)))(r)
\end{align*}</span></p>
<p>I am unable to define analogous function for <span class="math inline">\odot</span>, even though it
feels like it ought to be possible (using additivity maybe).</p>
<p><span class="math display">\begin{align*}
&amp;\mathrm{func}_\odot : (X \to Y) \to (\mathrm{U}A \to \mathrm{U}B) \to \mathrm{U}(X \odot A) \to \mathrm{U}(Y \odot B) \\
&amp;\mathrm{func}_\odot(f, g, u) :\equiv{???}
\end{align*}</span></p>
<h3 id="biproducts">Biproducts</h3>
<p>Global additivity gives <span class="math inline">A \mathbin{\&amp;} B</span> the universal property of
the coproduct. Let’s just rename the type former to <span class="math inline">A \oplus B</span> from
this point on (though in linear logic this is usually used for the
additive coproduct).</p>
<p><span class="math display">\begin{align*}
&amp;\mathsf{inl}:: A \multimap A \oplus B \\
&amp;\mathsf{inl}(a) :\equiv a \oplus 0 \\
&amp;\mathsf{inr}:: B \multimap A \oplus B \\
&amp;\mathsf{inr}(b) :\equiv 0 \oplus b 
\end{align*}</span></p>
<p>Coproduct induction comes from addition:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\begin{align*}
&amp;\mathsf{case} :: (A \multimap C) \oplus (B \multimap C) \multimap(A \oplus B) \multimap C \\ 
&amp;\mathsf{case}(r, s) :\equiv\mathsf{pr}_1(r)(\mathsf{pr}_1(s)) + \mathsf{pr}_2(r)(\mathsf{pr}_2(s))
\end{align*}</span></p>
<p>Or, if you prefer an inference rule:</p>
<div class="figure">
<!--\inferrule*{\Gamma \mid \Lambda \yields s :: A \oplus B \\
    \Gamma \mid \Lambda', a :: A \yields l :: C \and 
    \Gamma \mid \Lambda', b :: B \yields r :: C }
    {\Gamma \mid \Lambda, \Lambda' \yields (\case{s}{\inl(a)}{l}{\inr(b)}{r}) :: C}-->

<p>Multiplication corresponds to the unitor for <span class="math inline">ℝ</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\begin{align*}
&amp;\mathsf{mult} :: ℝ \otimes A \multimap A \\
&amp;\mathsf{mult}(\mathsf{e}\otimes a) :\equiv a \\
~\\
&amp;\mathsf{mult} :: ℝ \otimes ℝ \multimap ℝ \\
&amp;\mathsf{mult}(\mathsf{e}\otimes r) :\equiv r
\end{align*}</span></p>
<p>In the latter case, we could do unit-induction on both sides or just
keep it one-sided. We can derelict multiplication to a nonlinear map,
using the same idea as <span class="math inline">\mathrm{mon}_\mathrm{U}</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\begin{align*}
&amp;\mathrm{mult} : \mathrm{U}ℝ \times \mathrm{U}ℝ \to \mathrm{U}ℝ \\
&amp;\mathrm{mult}(a, b) :\equiv\partial \mathsf{e}. \mathsf{mult}(a(\mathsf{e}) \otimes b(\mathsf{e}))
\end{align*}</span></p>
<p>Nonlinearly, we have <span class="math inline">1 : \mathrm{U}ℝ</span> defined as the identity
homomorphism <span class="math inline">1 :\equiv\partial r. r</span>.</p>
<p>We certainly have <span class="math inline">0 :: ℝ</span> linearly because we put zero in as a rule,
from which we can define <span class="math inline">\partial r. 0 : \mathrm{U}ℝ</span>. Addition is <em>not</em>
bilinear, so the best we can hope for is a map <span class="math inline">\mathrm{U}ℝ \times \mathrm{U}ℝ
\to \mathrm{U}ℝ</span>, which we can define using global additivity.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\begin{align*}
&amp;\mathrm{add} : \mathrm{U}ℝ \times \mathrm{U}ℝ \to \mathrm{U}ℝ \\
&amp;\mathrm{add}(a, b) :\equiv\partial r. a(r) + b(r)
\end{align*}</span></p>
<p>At this point it would be sensible to check that the ring axioms hold
for <span class="math inline">\mathrm{U}ℝ</span>, using the equations we put in for <span class="math inline">+</span>.</p>
<h3 id="matmul">Matmul</h3>
<p>Let’s suppose we have (nonlinear) finite types <span class="math inline">\bold{n}</span>, which we can
pattern match on and manipulate as normal. Euclidean spaces
<span class="math inline">ℝ^\bold{n}</span> are defined by <span class="math inline">ℝ^\bold{n} :\equiv\bold{n} \odot ℝ</span>, or in
other words, <span class="math inline">\mathsf{F}\bold{n}</span>. We can define the dot product as a linear
map, using case analysis on the <em>nonlinear</em> Boolean value of <span class="math inline">i =
j</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\begin{align*}
&amp;\mathsf{dot} :: ℝ^\bold{n} \otimes ℝ^\bold{n} \multimap ℝ \\
&amp;\mathsf{dot}((i \odot r) \otimes (j \odot s)) :\equiv\mathsf{if}\;{i=j}\;\mathsf{then}\;{\mathsf{mult}(r, s)}\;\mathsf{else}\;{0}
\end{align*}</span></p>
<p>Or, if you want to be edgy:<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-9" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-9" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">In the special case of <span class="math inline">X \odot ℝ</span>, we
could write the term/pattern <span class="math inline">(i \odot \mathsf{e})</span> as <span class="math inline">\mathsf{e}_i</span>: it really
is like we’re pattern-matching on basis vectors. But I’ll resist doing
that in this post, to make it easier to remember that it’s really
<span class="math inline">\odot</span>.<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\begin{align*}
&amp;\mathsf{dot}((i \odot \mathsf{e}) \otimes (j \odot \mathsf{e})) :\equiv\mathsf{if}\;{i=j}\;\mathsf{then}\;{\mathsf{e}}\;\mathsf{else}\;{0}

\end{align*}</span></p>
<p>We are usually handed two separate vectors nonlinearly, and like
before we can handle this by dereliction.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\begin{align*}
&amp;\mathrm{dot} : \mathrm{U}ℝ^\bold{n} \times \mathrm{U}ℝ^\bold{n} \to \mathrm{U}ℝ \\
&amp;\mathrm{dot}(u, v) :\equiv\partial \mathsf{e}. \mathsf{dot}(u(\mathsf{e}) \otimes v(\mathsf{e}))
\end{align*}</span></p>
<p>These definitions generalise easily to matrix multiplication, by
functoriality of <span class="math inline">\otimes</span>. This is the place where the
linear/nonlinear logic really shines, so let’s hope there’s a lot of
this.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\begin{align*}

&amp;\mathsf{matmul}(v \otimes (i \odot \mathsf{e}) \otimes (j \odot \mathsf{e}) \otimes w) :\equiv\mathsf{if}\;{i=j}\;\mathsf{then}\;{v \otimes w}\;\mathsf{else}\;{0} \\
\end{align*}</span></p>
<!-- ~\\ -->
<!-- &\mathrm{matmul} : \adjU (ℝ^\fin{m} \otimes ℝ^\fin{n}) \times \adjU (ℝ^\fin{n} \otimes ℝ^\fin{k}) \to \adjU (ℝ^\fin{m} \otimes ℝ^\fin{k}) \\ -->
<!-- &\mathrm{matmul}(P, Q) :\defeq \partial \unit. \mathsf{matmul}(P(\unit) \otimes Q(\unit)) -->
<p>Of course, because we’re already working in a theory that has linear
functions, we’d much rather use those than explicit matrices wherever
we can.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\begin{align*}
&amp;\mathsf{unexplode}_\multimap:: (ℝ^\bold{n} \otimes A) \multimap(ℝ^\bold{n} \multimap A) \\
&amp;\mathsf{unexplode}_\multimap(v \otimes a)(w) :\equiv\mathsf{mult}(\mathsf{dot}(v \otimes w) \otimes a) \\
\end{align*}</span></p>
<p>It might come in handy to know that <span class="math inline">\mathsf{unexplode}_\multimap</span> is a
linear map, but of course we can also define the same thing
nonlinearly:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\begin{align*}
&amp;\mathrm{unexplode}_{\mathrm{Vec}_{\mathbb{R}}} : \mathrm{U}(ℝ^\bold{n} \otimes A) \to \mathrm{Vec}_{\mathbb{R}}(ℝ^\bold{n}, A) \\
&amp;\mathrm{unexplode}_{\mathrm{Vec}_{\mathbb{R}}}(t)(w) :\equiv\mathsf{unexplode}_\multimap(t(\mathsf{e}))(w)
\end{align*}</span></p>
<p>To define the inverse of this, we’ll need to cover iteration.</p>
<h3 id="iteration">Iteration</h3>
<p>How do we iterate over a vector of real numbers? Realistically, we
probably want iteration over a vector to be a primitive<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-10" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-10" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">As it is in
<a href="https://futhark-lang.org/">Futhark</a>, for example.<br />
<br />
</span></span>, but assuming some
reasonable rules for the finite types <span class="math inline">\bold{n}</span> we can do it by
induction.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-11" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-11" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">These examples do need proper nonlinear dependent types to

<br />
</span></span></p>
<p>The linear isomorphism</p>
<p><span class="math display">\begin{align*}

<p><span class="math display">\begin{align*}

where <span class="math inline">\iota :: ℝ^\bold{n} \multimap ℝ^\bold{n+1}</span> is the inclusion <span class="math inline">\iota(i \odot e) :\equiv\mathsf{suc}(i) \odot e</span>. Nonlinearly:</p>

<p>What does it look like to apply a nonlinear function along an axis?
This can’t be done generically, in the sense of defining a map</p>
<p><span class="math display">
\mathrm{map}_2 : (\mathrm{U}B \to \mathrm{U}C) \to \mathrm{U}(A \otimes B) \to \mathrm{U}(A \otimes C)
</span></p>
<p>for an arbitrary linear type <span class="math inline">A</span>, because the result really does
depend on a choice of basis for <span class="math inline">A</span>. This is easiest to do if we first
take the inputs in unexploded form.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-13" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-13" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Using <span class="math inline">X \odot ℝ</span> makes clear
that this function <em>does</em> require us to pick a basis, but <em>doesn’t</em>
require the vector space to be finite dimensional.<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\begin{align*}
&amp;\mathrm{along} : (\mathrm{U}B \to \mathrm{U}C) \to \mathrm{Vec}_{\mathbb{R}}(X \odot ℝ, B) \to \mathrm{Vec}_{\mathbb{R}}(X \odot ℝ, C) \\
&amp;\mathrm{along}(f, h)(i \odot r) :\equiv f(\partial r&#39;. h(i \odot r&#39;))(r)\\
\end{align*}</span></p>
<p>Now, if we really want to define <span class="math inline">\mathsf{map}_2</span> as map on (the
underlying set of) the tensor type, we unexplode the matrix into a
homomorphism, compose, and then re-explode:<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-14" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-14" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">And here, we see that the
final exploding step is the only place we actually need that
<span class="math inline">\mathbb{R}^\mathbf{q}</span> is finite dimensional.<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\begin{align*}
\mathrm{U}(\mathbb{R}^\mathbf{q} \otimes B) \longrightarrow \mathrm{Vec}_{\mathbb{R}}(\mathbb{R}^\mathbf{q}, B) \longrightarrow \mathrm{Vec}_{\mathbb{R}}(\mathbb{R}^\mathbf{q}, C) \longrightarrow \mathrm{U}(\mathbb{R}^\mathbf{q} \otimes C)
\end{align*}</span></p>
<p>So:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\begin{align*}
&amp;\mathrm{map}_2 : (\mathrm{U}B \to \mathrm{U}C) \to \mathrm{U}(\mathbb{R}^\mathbf{q} \otimes B) \to \mathrm{U}(\mathbb{R}^\mathbf{q} \otimes C) \\
&amp;\mathrm{map}_2(f) :\equiv\mathrm{explode} \circ \mathrm{along}(f) \circ \mathrm{unexplode}
\end{align*}</span></p>
<h3 id="attention">Attention</h3>
<p>Let’s try to apply what we’ve learned so far to the most famous
linear/nonlinear map of <span class="math inline">ℝ</span>-vector spaces in the world: the attention
mechanism. Here’s a string diagram of what we’re trying to replicate
in code, where the “caps” represent the <span class="math inline">\mathrm{dot}</span> map from above,
and the triangular node represents <span class="math inline">\mathrm{softmax}</span>:<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-15" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-15" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">I find these kinds of
“string diagrams” quite confusing, because the interchange law fails
when mixing linear/nonlinear maps and the meaning of a diagram is not
invariant under isotopy. In other words, the relative horizontal
position of the nodes matters; even when the nodes are completely
disconnected from one other. Here, pulling the upper cap past the
<span class="math inline">\mathrm{softmax}</span> results in a different map.<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<figure>
<img src="/diagrams/attention.png" alt="Attention as a “neural circuit diagram”, from https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09326 by Abbott et al." />

</figure>
<p>Of course, we can’t fuse this into a single linear map because it
involves the non-linear <span class="math inline">\mathrm{softmax}: \mathrm{U}ℝ^\bold{n} \to \mathrm{U}ℝ</span>.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-16" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-16" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">We
could define <span class="math inline">\mathrm{softmax}</span> ourselves using iteration, if we assume we

ℝ \to \mathrm{U}ℝ</span>, say.<br />
<br />
</span></span> Taken literally, that diagram is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\begin{align*}
&amp;\mathrm{attention} : \mathrm{U}(ℝ^\bold{q} \otimes ℝ^\bold{k}) \times \mathrm{U}(ℝ^\bold{x} \otimes ℝ^\bold{k}) \times \mathrm{U}(ℝ^\bold{x} \otimes ℝ^\bold{k}) \to \mathrm{U}(ℝ^\bold{q} \otimes ℝ^\bold{k})
\end{align*}</span></p>
<p>But we’re better just using <span class="math inline">\mathrm{Vec}_{\mathbb{R}}</span> everywhere we can, and exploding
things later if we really want:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\begin{align*}
&amp;\mathrm{attention} : \mathrm{Vec}_{\mathbb{R}}(ℝ^\bold{q}, K) \times \mathrm{Vec}_{\mathbb{R}}(K, X) \times \mathrm{Vec}_{\mathbb{R}}(X, K) \to \mathrm{Vec}_{\mathbb{R}}(ℝ^\bold{q}, K) \\
&amp;\mathrm{attention}(Q, K, V) :\equiv V \circ \mathrm{along}(\mathrm{softmax})(K \circ Q)
\end{align*}</span></p>
<p>This is the definition we get just clicking things together. If we
inline all the definitions, it’s a bit more direct.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\begin{align*}
&amp;\mathrm{attention} : \mathrm{Vec}_{\mathbb{R}}(ℝ^\bold{q}, K) \times \mathrm{Vec}_{\mathbb{R}}(K, X) \times \mathrm{Vec}_{\mathbb{R}}(X, K) \to \mathrm{Vec}_{\mathbb{R}}(ℝ^\bold{q}, K) \\
&amp;\mathrm{attention}(Q, K, V)(q \odot \mathsf{e}) :\equiv V(\mathrm{softmax}(\partial r. K(Q(q \odot r))))
\end{align*}</span></p>
<p>This is about as simple as we could hope for! It almost looks like we
haven’t done anything at all, but this syntax tracks and enforces the
correct interaction of the linear and nonlinear parts of the
definition. I think this is a good place to stop for now.</p>
<h2 id="dependent-types">Dependent Types</h2>
<p>One probably wants a version of this that has dependent nonlinear
types, and linear types that can depend on those nonlinear types (but
not on other linear types). If nothing else, we need this to actually
justify the way we used the finite types <span class="math inline">\bold{n}</span>. For inspiration
one should probably look at:</p>

<p>The thesis demonstrates how to implement LNL as an embedded language
inside a nonlinear host language like Haskell or Coq, and this looks
like it works very well in practice. If I understand right, the focus
is more on using the nonlinear language as a metalanguage for the
linear language, rather than considering the whole system together as
being semantically useful. This is also the case for the Quipper line
of work. Her <span class="math inline">\mathtt{Box}</span> constructor is like the external hom,
which I here called <span class="math inline">\mathrm{Vec}_{\mathbb{R}}(-,-)</span>.</p>

<p>The first paper considers additivity in the context of the ordinary
lambda calculus, and the second considers additivity in the context of
intuitionistic linear logic but with a dual-zone context structure
different to ours. There are only linear types, with the “nonlinear”
part of the context corresponding to linear types that have had the
<span class="math inline">{!}</span> comonad applied. Accordingly, there are no nonlinear type
formers, like functions/products/coproducts etc.</p>
<p>There is also some work on modelling the lambda calculus directly in
finite dimensional vector spaces over finite fields.</p>

\mathrm{U}</span> (in our notation) is strong monoidal: <span class="math inline">{!}(A \times B) \cong
{!}A \otimes {!}B</span>. This is not a problem for us, because our
priority is matching the semantics in <span class="math inline">\mathbb{R}</span>-vector spaces
rather than matching the linear logic rules for <span class="math inline">!</span>.</p>

    <title>The Cars In My Backyard</title>
    <link href="http://mvr.github.io/posts/cars-in-my-backyard.html" />
    <id>http://mvr.github.io/posts/cars-in-my-backyard.html</id>
    <published>April 21, 2025</published>
    <updated>2025-04-21T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When I walk around my neighbourhood, I am struck by the beautiful
character of the houses here: the draughty Queenslanders and timber
fences, the majestic external staircases, I could go on forever. But
something always felt off, and I finally realise what it is. How can I
admire a house with elegant stilts and sweeping verandahs when there
is a bright red 2019 Ford Puma sitting in the driveway? Or appreciate
a compact, postwar masterpiece when it has a Hilux poking out around
the side? In the hours I’ve spent positioning myself on the street so
I can bathe in the heritage of my neighbourhood, I have not found an
angle without some such monstrosity in my field of view.</p>
<p>We’ve spent years fighting the vandals who want to destroy the
heritage of our neighbourhood. Why should we make an exception for
this? I see no other option: we must forbid residents from bringing
any new cars into the area. This is already a compromise, as if I had
my way we would ban every car newer than the house it is parked in
front of. (Of course, some especially old houses would need hitching
posts to be reinstalled.)</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I’ll be specific. Any house on the heritage register should be banned
from locating a non-heritage-appropriate vehicle on the premises. Any
resident who buys a new car must submit an impact assessment to be
evaluated by the vehicle heritage committee.</p>
<p>It’s not that I have an issue with cars; I just think they should be
<em>appropriate</em> and <em>affordable</em> cars. It’s hard to imagine anybody
disagreeing with this, but I already hear the “NIMBY” slur from the
usual suspects.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>“This would be an assault on our personal freedom.”</strong></p>
<p>Whose freedom is really at stake here? The residents of our
community should be free to live in a neighbourhood that respects
its heritage, something we are currently being deprived of. There
is no reason that your personal preferences should be inflicted on
the rest of the community.</p>
<p>If you are not happy with our efforts to maintain the character of
the neighbourhood, you are perfectly free to live in a place where
people drive cars more to your taste. What the modern car activists
demand is the silencing of local opinion: does that sound like
freedom to you?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>“This application process would be excessive and onerous.”</strong></p>
<p>The community should have a say in what vehicles are allowed on
their street, it’s as simple as that. It’s shocking what people are
able to get away with; an impact assessment for each new vehicle is
really not that much to ask.</p>
<p>Anyone worried that the committee would be too strict can rest
easy. Myself and some other passionate community members ran a
small trial involving people with a range of backgrounds – from
owners of pre-war classics to mid-century sedan enthusiasts. After
discussing which makes and models we would be willing to accept, I
am happy to say that we approved <em>many</em> of the heritage-appropriate
cars that were submitted. These regulations really would not be a
burden.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>“Old cars are worse than modern ones: less efficient, less
powerful, less convenient, less safe.”</strong></p>
<p>This is a non-issue. Nobody is preventing you from replacing the
engine and interior of your character-appropriate car with
something that suits you better. Why don’t we hear about this kind
of conversion happening more often? It’s because these problems are
imagined: clearly people are happy with their heritage cars as they
are. Although now that you mention it, the committee might want to
get a look-in on the interior too.</p>
<p>In any case, there are workarounds. In rare situations, and
strictly subject to the committee’s approval, it may be enough to
change the shape of a part of the offending car so that its
character-ruining design is not visible from the street. These are
the kinds of improvements that we on the committee could generously
assist a car owner by suggesting. Frankly, they should be grateful
that the committee is considering the non-compliant proposal at
all.</p>
<p>Slowing down the churn of new vehicles is all to the good: we want
to encourage people to maintain and cherish their beautiful
existing vehicles. Ultimately this is far more sustainable than
having people switch to newer cars. Our group has the full support
of local environmentalists in this regard.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>“Some people would get a lot of benefit from a new car.”</strong></p>
<p>Of course, but let’s check the other side of the ledger, how the
rest of our community is affected. Do we have the infrastructure to
support all the cars that people want to bring in? Adding any more
before improving the existing roads is irresponsible. Reducing the
number of people who could drive, which wouldn’t happen, would in
any case be a good thing, if it did happen, which it won’t. I’m
sure you agree our traffic problem is out of control.</p>
<p>Think also of how bright LED headlights can be. This is not a joke:
the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or
Degrading Treatment or Punishment makes very clear that sleep
deprivation is capable of amounting to torture. I encourage you to
bring this up at the next council meeting.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>“Allowing modern cars means cars are cheaper and accessible to
more people.”</strong></p>
<p>Finally, the economic illiteracy we all knew was coming. The price
of a car is influenced by a multitude of factors: global supply
chains, financing tricks, tax incentives and manufacturer greed, to
name a few. There’s no evidence that our heritage rules would have
any impact on the price or availability of cars.</p>
<p>In fact, the current free-for-all is probably contributing to the
price issue. Beyond lining the pockets of car manufacturers, having
“luxury” cars in our neighbourhood increases demand for similar
cars, and so in fact increases their price for everyone. The way to
have truly affordable cars is to preserve the existing stock of
older vehicles and prevent the speculation caused by these new
luxury models.</p>
<p>Like everyone, I believe Australia will need more cars to match our
growing population. But is our neighbourhood really the best place
for them to go? There are already lots of cars here, and plenty of
Holden EHs and Valiants to go around. And if there does end up
being a shortage, it’s clear who’s to blame: anyone who owns one of
these cars and don’t drive it much.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>“Making only heritage cars is not feasible for car
manufacturers.”</strong></p>
<p>When people make this claim you should check them for an earpiece:
they are getting their lines directly from the manufacturers. Who
do you think profits most from the current free-for-all? The
manufacturers who want to pump out modern cars for people to
endlessly buy; it’s pure corporate greed.</p>
<p>Sure, it could be that the heritage committee reduces the inflated
profits of corporations. I struggle to see how this is an issue. If
Toyota isn’t interested in building a perfect replica of the Ford
Falcon XK, the solution is simple: manufacturers should be forced
to reserve some minimum percentage of their fleet for heritage
vehicles. If we allow manufacturers to build however they like,
they will only ever build their unaffordable luxury cars.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t have such a problem with these modern cars if they were
just built to a higher standard. Some of them are so small; no one
wants to drive a Kia. We should enforce at least a minimum boot
size to prevent these unreasonable cars from being built in the
first place, that would certainly save the manufacturers a lot of
trouble.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Write to your councillor to demand a vehicle heritage committee.
Myself and the other concerned residents stand ready to serve.</p>]]></summary>

<p><a href="https://conwaylife.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=9&amp;t=5997">QuFince</a> is a CUDA tool written by <a href="https://cp4space.hatsya.com/">apg</a> to conduct brute-force Game

<p>One thing that <em>can’t</em> be done currently is have QuFince report any
combination that results in an interesting still life, but without
knowing which still life you want in advance. It’s not so obvious what
“interesting still life” should mean exactly, but here are some
randomly chosen examples of things that should qualify:</p>

<p>We can’t use a population threshold as our criterion for
interestingness, because the typical result of one of these QuFince
trials is a bunch of uninteresting junk. One option is to do proper
object separation, like <a href="https://gitlab.com/apgoucher/apgmera">apgsearch</a>, and then report any object that
is sufficiently rare. But a QuFince search can conceivably test
hundreds of billions of configurations, and full object separation is
simply too slow.</p>
<p>Here I’ll present an alternative, a simple heuristic that works well
enough. <!--more--> There are some constraints, but most important is
that our mistakes only go in one direction. False negatives are
disappointing, because we might be missing out on a cool result. But
false positives are catastrophic because they cause a firehose of
useless results, which defeats the purpose of using QuFince in the
first place.</p>
<p>To evaluate how we’re doing, we’ll test the heuristic on the 10,000
most common still lifes. We’ll declare any still life with population
<span class="math inline">\geq 18</span> to be “interesting”, and any still life with population
<span class="math inline">\leq 10</span> to be a deal-breaker that <em>must</em> be rejected.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">These
thresholds are somewhat arbitrary.<br />
<br />
</span></span> Our goal is to correctly classify
as many of the remaining 10,000 as possible.</p>

<p>The first thing that comes to mind is that rare still lifes often have
a dense middle, so we should devise a fast check for dense regions. If
we fill in the “holes” in the ash, a dense region will show up as a
place where we can fit a decently sized square. Or stated a different
way, if we inflate the ash a bit, and then deflate the result a bit
more, the only way anything can remain is if there was some thing
decently sized to begin with.</p>

<p>This is quite efficient to evaluate when the state is represented by
as a bitplane (as it is in QuFince and LifeAPI). It’s a good start and
correctly identifies 7223/10000 still lifes, but it does have some
unacceptable false positives:</p>

<p>Changing the precise kind of inflation/deflation helps. To test this
systematically, I defined a handful of “neighbourhoods” and tried all
combinations. Some of the neighbourhoods I tried are things like:<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-2" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">I
also threw in some more exotic neighbourhoods, but none turned out to
help.<br />

<p>What worked by far the best was the following pair, so inflating by
the radius-1 von Neumann neighbourhood on the left and deflating by

<p>One thing that jumps out is that many of them contain a orthogonal
line of length at least 5. This is also efficient to test for, doesn’t
occur in any of our deal-breakers, and improves the detection rate to
7337/10000. However, there’s a downside: it does pick up the
<a href="https://conwaylife.com/wiki/Fourteener">fourteener</a>, a surprisingly common still life that happens to contain
a line of five.</p>

<p>The fourteener is the 43<sup>rd</sup> most common still life, and one
needs to go down to 75<sup>th</sup> and then 138<sup>th</sup> to see
another line like that. The improvement is too good to give up, so I
just filter these fourteeners out as a special case.</p>
<p>The new set of missed still lifes begins as follows, and it’s less
easy to spot a common feature that could be tested for.</p>

<p>Here’s where I stopped. Any ideas?</p>
<p>I’ve been putting this into practice by searching for new glider
syntheses, crashing 6 randomly placed gliders together. You can see
some of the results as I go <a href="https://catagolue.hatsya.com/census/b3s23/mvr_qufince_stdin">here</a>. I work a lot more efficiently than
previous attempts (like the <code>moog_stdin</code> and <code>5Glider_stdin</code>
symmetries), because 1) I make sure the gliders actually collide
rather than positioning them completely randomly, and 2) I do the vast
majority of the work on the GPU kernel rather than piping an RLE
generator into apgsearch.</p>
<p>This has already turned up a handful of record-breaking syntheses
after just a couple of hours, and I’m looking forward to a lot more.
Here’s one chosen at random. If you have a powerful GPU and also want
to do some searches, let me know!</p>

<p><strong>Edit (11/05/25):</strong> Indeed this was extremely productive, producing
many hundreds of new syntheses. Here are some of the clean ones
involving 6 gliders, each of which feels pretty miraculous.</p>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<script defer src="/life/lv-plugin.js"></script>
<p>As a second foray into CUDA, I’ve written a simple program to hunt for
<a href="https://conwaylife.com/wiki/Crawler">crawlers</a> in the Game of Life. The kernel itself is too revolting to
make public, but the supporting <a href="https://github.com/mvr/LifeAPI/blob/master/cuda/LifeStateCU.cu"><code>LifeStateCU</code></a> code may be useful for
others. (This could be seen as the first step in a GPU version of
<code>CatForce</code>/<code>LightCone</code>…)</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The method by which each state is stored is taken from apg’s
<a href="https://gitlab.com/apgoucher/lifelib/-/blob/master/cuda2/cudagol.h"><code>lifelib</code></a>. Briefly, each warp stores a 64×64 torus using one <code>uint4</code>
per thread. This <code>uint4</code> is a 2×2 array of <code>uint32_t</code> values,
representing a 64×2 strip of the state.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-0" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-0" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Annoyingly, the decade-old
<code>CatForce</code> arranges its state in column-major rather than row-major
order, so there is a mismatch here.<br />
<br />
</span></span> Operations involving information
from multiple rows can be done using the efficient warp-level
intrinsics, avoiding any use of shared memory.</p>
<p>For example, fetching the state of a single cell can be achieved
having the thread that contains the relevant row shuffle the value of
that row to all other threads:<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Of course you should try desperately
to avoid writing code that works one cell at a time! This is just an
example.<br />
<br />

<p>The particular bit twiddles used in the <code>advance()</code> step were
<a href="https://binary-banter.github.io/game-of-life/">discovered</a> by Julia “Vlamonster” using a SAT solver. I’ve added many
of the functions from <code>LifeAPI</code> to make it easier to work with.</p>
<p>Given an active pattern, the program runs an almost-brute-force search
on a list of reagent placements, running them a fixed duration and
checking whether the active pattern reoccurs at any time, at any
location. Trying to match the active pattern is fairly expensive, more
expensive than advancing the state itself. We place reagents in the
reaction envelope of the pattern, rather than in some region fixed in
advance.</p>
<p>The list of reagents to try was determined by a one-off script that
ran some soups and catalogued the most common ash. Here’s what it
found:</p>

coins (or if you prefer, piles of beans, or <a href="https://www.routledge.com/Winning-Ways-for-Your-Mathematical-Plays-Volume-1/Berlekamp-Conway-Guy/p/book/9781568811307">officers and their

the equivalent game Couples-are-Forever, a move is to choose a heap
and split it into two, with the proviso that you may not split a heap
of size 2. An Officers heap of size <span class="math inline">n</span> is equivalent to a
Couples-are-Forever heap of size <span class="math inline">n+1</span>.<br />
<br />
</span></span>, or …). The two players
alternate turns, and every turn consists of removing a coin from a
heap and leaving the remainder in either one or two heaps. In
particular, taking away a lone coin is not a valid move. The winner is
the last player who can make a move.</p>
<p>For example, a game starting with a single pile of <span class="math inline">10</span> coins might
proceed</p>
<p><span class="math display">
[10] 
\xrightarrow{\mathcal{L}} [3, 6] 
\xrightarrow{\mathcal{R}} [3, 1, 4]
\xrightarrow{\mathcal{L}} [1, 1, 1, 4]
\xrightarrow{\mathcal{R}} [1, 1, 1, 1, 2]
\xrightarrow{\mathcal{L}} [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
</span></p>
<p>at which point player <span class="math inline">\mathcal{R}</span> is stuck, so player <span class="math inline">\mathcal{L}</span>
has won.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">In fact, he was following the winning strategy.<br />
<br />
</span></span> Although
the total number of coins decreases by 1 each turn, the outcome of the
game is not determined simply by the parity of the starting number of
coins: the moment that the game ends also depends on how many piles
are created by the players making splitting moves. As we will soon
see, the winning move from any given position is extremely
unpredictable.</p>
<p>We can solve a game of this kind by calculating the <em>Grundy value</em> for
each position, and in this post I’m going to discuss my attempt at
calculating these values for Officers as fast as possible.</p>

<h2 id="spraguegrundy-theory">Sprague–Grundy Theory</h2>
<p>Here’s a very compressed outline of Sprague-Grundy theory, just what
we need to work on Officers.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-3" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-3" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">See the references for more details.<br />

</span></span></p>
<p>The <em>Grundy value</em> of an Officers position is the equivalent size of
heap in the game of <em>Nim</em>. This this value must exist thanks to the
Sprague–Grundy theorem, which states that every “impartial game” (both
players have the same options from any position) under the “normal
play convention” (a player who can’t make a move loses) is equivalent
to a one-heap game of Nim. The winning strategy in Nim is easy, so the
strategy for Officers becomes to convert the position to Nim,
determine the winning move, and convert back.</p>
<p>Nim is also played with heaps of coins, but the rules are simpler. In
Nim, a turn consists of choosing a pile and removing any number of
coins, possibly all of them. For a single pile, the strategy for the
first player is obvious: take the entire pile and you win. For two
equal piles, the second player can win: replicate whatever move is
made on one pile to the other, and eventually the first player will
run out of options.</p>
<p>To get at the general strategy, suppose we have a “false” Nim heap
where all the options are ordinary Nim heaps, say, a “heap” where we
can move to one of 0, 1, 4 or 5. This behaves like a heap of size 2,
but where we also have the option to increase the heap to 4 or 5. But!
These latter two moves cannot be part of a winning strategy, because
the opponent can always make a reversing move back to the (true) Nim
heap of size 2, and thereby force you to make a move to 0 or 1. And so
our false Nim heap is equivalent to the heap of size 2, the <em>minimal
excluded value</em> of all of its options. (Sanity check: for a true Nim
heap of size <span class="math inline">n</span>, indeed <span class="math inline">n</span> is the first excluded option.)</p>
<p>To determine the value <span class="math inline">x ⊕ y</span> of Nim games with two piles of size <span class="math inline">x</span>
and <span class="math inline">y</span>, we apply this rule inductively. From <span class="math inline">1 ⊕ 2</span> we can move to
any of <span class="math inline">\{0 ⊕ 2, 1 ⊕ 1, 1 ⊕ 0\}</span>, which have known values <span class="math inline">\{2, 0,
1\}</span>. The minimum excluded value is 3, so <span class="math inline">2 ⊕ 1 = 3</span>. Continuing a
little further,<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-4" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-4" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Computing these MEXes also reveals the winning
strategy for each sum: move to a position with value 0. So for these
sums, <span class="math inline">1 ⊕ 3 \rightsquigarrow 1 ⊕ 1</span> and <span class="math inline">2 ⊕ 3 \rightsquigarrow 2 ⊕
2</span>.<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\begin{align*}
1 ⊕ 3 &amp;= \mathrm{mex}(0⊕3, 1⊕2, 1⊕1, 1⊕0) &amp;&amp;= \mathrm{mex}(3, 3, 0, 1) &amp;&amp;= 2 \\
2 ⊕ 3 &amp;= \mathrm{mex}(1⊕3, 0⊕3, 2⊕2, 2⊕1, 2⊕0) &amp;&amp;= \mathrm{mex}(2, 3, 0, 3, 2) &amp;&amp;= 1
\end{align*}</span></p>
<p>In general, one can show that the Nim sum <span class="math inline">x ⊕ y</span> is binary XOR, or if
you like, vector addition over <span class="math inline">\mathbb{F}_2</span>.</p>
<p>Now how do we apply this to Officers? We consider each Officer heap as
a false Nim heap and identify the minimal excluded value.</p>
<p>From Officers heaps of size 0 and 1 there are no moves, so <span class="math inline">G(0) =
G(1) = 0</span>. From position 2, there is a unique move to 1, so <span class="math inline">G(2) =
\mathrm{mex}(G(1)) = \mathrm{mex}(0) = 1</span>. From position 3, we now
have a choice after removing a coin: whether or not to split the
result. The two options are therefore <span class="math inline">G(2)</span> or <span class="math inline">G(1) ⊕ G(1)</span>, which
evaluate to <span class="math inline">1</span> or <span class="math inline">0</span>, so <span class="math inline">G(3) = 2</span>. Generally,</p>
<p><span class="math display"> G(x) = \mathrm{mex}(G(i) ⊕ G(x - i - 1) \mid 0 \leq i \leq x-1) </span></p>
<p>with <span class="math inline">G(0)=0</span> as a base case. The first few values are:</p>
<p><span class="math display"> 0, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4, 0, 3, 4, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, \dots</span></p>
<p>This sequence appears on the OEIS as
<a href="https://oeis.org/A046695">A046695</a>. It quickly climbs out of the
single digits and then bounces around, mostly in the range <span class="math inline">[0, 256]</span>.</p>

<p>There are a couple of basic improvements we can make. Firstly, we only
need to run through around half the loop, because past the midpoint we
are computing the XOR of the same values but swapped.</p>
<p>Secondly, all known values (into the trillions) are less than 512, so
we are better off using a <code>std::array&lt;bool, 512&gt;</code> or similar to record
the values that we are applying MEX to. We are willing to take the
gamble that we will never calculate values for long enough to see them
reach 512.</p>
<p>The result is an algorithm that calculates values at around 11K values
per second. (And which slows down as time passes.)</p>
<h2 id="the-rare-value-algorithm">The Rare-Value Algorithm</h2>
<p>Empirically, some values appear far more often than others. This is
underselling it: there are a handful of values that occur a finite
number of times and then never seem to appear again.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-5" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-5" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Notably the

<p>Many octal games have an analogous property that divides rare values
from common ones. There is no rhyme or reason to which bits end up the
relevant ones for this property, they seem to emerge from the chaos of
the initial handful of values. But once a pattern like this is
established it is almost impossible to dislodge, for the following
reason. Because the condition is based on parity, it is not hard to
check the rules:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\begin{align*}
&amp;\text{common} &amp;&amp;\oplus \,\text{common} &amp;&amp;= \text{rare} \\
&amp;\text{rare} &amp;&amp;\oplus \,\text{rare} &amp;&amp;= \text{rare} \\
&amp;\text{rare} &amp;&amp;\oplus \,\text{common} &amp;&amp;= \text{common}
\end{align*}</span></p>
<p>Now consider the collection <span class="math inline">\{G(i) ⊕ G(x - i - 1) \mid 0 \leq i \leq
x-1\}</span> that we are taking the MEX of to determine <span class="math inline">G(x)</span>.
As <span class="math inline">x</span> becomes large, the values <span class="math inline">G(i) ⊕ G(x - i - 1)</span> will be
dominated by those of the form <span class="math inline">(\text{common} \oplus \text{common})</span>,
i.e. rare values, because there are vastly more common values than
rare ones. The first missing value is therefore likely to be common,
because only members of the smaller collection of sums <span class="math inline">(\text{rare}
\oplus \text{common})</span> are capable of landing on common values.</p>
<p>Knowing that values are likely to be common suggests the following
approach. First, calculate all <span class="math inline">(\text{rare} \oplus \text{common})</span>
sums, and thereby determine the first missing <em>common</em> value. This is
overwhelmingly likely to be the correct value in the end, but to
verify this we’ll have to check sums not of this form. Here’s the key:
we only have to rule out the rare values <em>below</em> this missing common
value, and as soon as we’ve done this we can stop. Usually, the rare
possibilities can be eliminated after checking a small number of
additional sums. No further sums can possibly eliminate that first
missing common value.</p>
<p>Here’s how this might look.</p>

<p>This is a big improvement: we are now generating values at a rate of
50K/s. For now, we’re going to put aside the verification step and
focus on calculating the speculative common values as fast as
possible. There is a good parallelisable algorithm for verifying these
common values<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-6" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-6" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">You can do the verification for each value completely
independently, under the assumption that the values that came before
it were correct. Only rarely (i.e. apparently never) is this
assumption violated, at which point you can redo the later ones that
relied on that incorrect value. And we had better hope it never
actually happens, because a new rare value out past 140 trillion will
make solving the game basically impossible.<br />
<br />
</span></span>, so if our goal is push
the calculation further than Grossman then getting these candidate
values as fast as possible is the whole ballgame.</p>
<h2 id="values-as-bytes">Values as Bytes</h2>
<p>Grossman observes that, because a) all known values are less than 512
and b) common values obey a parity constraint, we can compress common
values into 8 bits instead of 9. This is a big win: we can store each
value in one byte rather than two. He does this by chopping off the
highest bit and reconstructing it when necessary. Importantly, this
doesn’t affect the calculation of the Nim sum:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\mathrm{compress}(x \oplus y) = \mathrm{compress}(x) \oplus \mathrm{compress}(y) </span></p>
<p>Here we can make a minor improvement. The downside of removing the
highest bit is that this doesn’t preserve order. The difference has to
be accounted for when calculating the MEX, to avoid picking an
incorrect “smallest value”.</p>
<p>Instead, we can cut out the 1st bit and shift all higher bits down by
one. This does preserve order, and so we only ever have to think about
compression when we want to present the output.</p>

<h2 id="calculating-a-block-of-values">Calculating a Block of Values</h2>
<p>The above few sections have just been recapitulating previous work,
now it’s time to do something GPU specific.</p>
<p>In CUDA, operations are performed in “blocks” of “threads”, with a
block executed collectively on a “streaming multiprocessor”.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-7" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-7" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">I am
going to stop with the scare quotes now.<br />
<br />
</span></span> For hardware reasons, it is
best for a block to have some multiple of 32 threads; a typical number
might be 256. Our plan is to have each thread compute one additional
Officers value. Let’s focus on a single block to keep things simple
for now.</p>
<p>Suppose we already know all values at positions smaller than <span class="math inline">n</span> and
we are now trying to simultaneously compute the values for the range
<span class="math inline">[n, n+B)</span>, where <span class="math inline">B</span> is the number of threads in our block. Our goal
is to run the first loop of the above algorithm simultaneously over
the block. So that all threads can make progress at the same time, we
want the computation to be as uniform as possible across those
threads. For each rare position <span class="math inline">p</span>, all threads will calculate <span class="math inline">G(p)
\oplus G(x - 1 - p)</span> for that rare value<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-8" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-8" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">These rare values and their
locations can be stored in <code>__constant__</code> memory, luckily it is fast
to broadcast a single value from constant memory to all threads in a
block.<br />
<br />
</span></span>, and record the result as ruled out for the MEX. In other
words, at each step we are using a <span class="math inline">B</span> sized window over the previous
values, whose location is determined by the position of each rare
value. We’ll run through the rare positions largest to smallest, so
that the range of previous values we’re inspecting moves from to
oldest to newest, with the window starting on the range <span class="math inline">[n-M, n-M+B)</span>
and ending on the range <span class="math inline">[n, n+B)</span>, where <span class="math inline">M=20627</span> is the position of
the last known rare value.</p>
<p>Of course, we have to be careful: the values in the range <span class="math inline">[n, n+B)</span>
aren’t actually known yet, they’re what we’re calculating right now.
The computation naturally splits into two phases:<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-9" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-9" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">These diagrams may
not be very helpful, but it was satisfying to get TiKZ working on this

<li><p><strong>Backwards:</strong> For all threads simultaneously, compute the sums
involving a rare value and an already-known common value. So for
the rare value at position <span class="math inline">p</span>, we are reading the window:</p>

nothing. This happens when the rare value has position <span class="math inline">p \in [0,

<p>Because the index <code>array[i/32]</code> is not a compile-time constant,
there’s a risk that this <code>array</code> will end up in local memory rather
than in registers if the compiler can’t figure out this can be written
as an unrolled loop.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-10" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-10" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Despite the name, local memory is actually a
thread-specific piece of <em>global</em> memory. It’s where, for example,
spilled registers get stored.<br />

</span></span> For reasons mysterious to me, sometimes
the compiler can do this and sometimes not. Just in case, we’ll do the
optimisation by hand.</p>
<p>We can manually write the operation as a loop:</p>

<p>This compiles to a straight-line program, using predicated
instructions to operate on the correct entry of the array.</p>
<p>Here’s a alternative trick which comes out slightly ahead and, for
reasons again mysterious to me, seems to cause less register pressure.</p>

<p>We use a “clamped funnel shift” to produce the correct mask for each
array entry directly. For this operation, shifting by more than 32 is
clamped to a shift of exactly 32 rather than wrapping around back to
zero. So, for an array entry <code>j</code> that is too small, the 0 value is
fully shifted into the result. And when <code>j</code> is too large, the shift
distance underflows and again the 0 is fully shifted in.</p>
<p>At the end of the main loop, the MEX can be computed from the mask by
using the <code>__ffs</code> (“find first set”) intrinsic to pick out the first 0
bit.</p>

<p>While we’re at it, we’ll can shove the MEX array into a <code>struct</code>
rather than using an array directly, and manually unroll the loop into
8 separate <code>struct</code> members. For reasons unclear to me, this does
cause a slight speed improvement.</p>
<h2 id="multiple-blocks">Multiple Blocks</h2>
<p>Of course, we don’t want to restrict ourselves to only one block: the
GPU has several multiprocessors that can run blocks simultaneously. We
might have <span class="math inline">K</span> blocks going at once, so that block 0 is responsible
for computing the range <span class="math inline">[n, n+B)</span>, block 1 is responsible for the
range <span class="math inline">[n+B, n+2B)</span>, and so on.</p>
<p>We have to modify the backwards phase, because a block may catch up to
values currently being computed by earlier blocks and have to wait for
that to complete. On a step with rare position <span class="math inline">p</span>, the latest
position in the current range, i.e. <span class="math inline">n + B - 1</span>, will need to read
from the buffer at position <span class="math inline">(n + B - 1) - p - 1</span>. We can be certain
other blocks aren’t working on that position as long as it is strictly
less than <span class="math inline">n - B(K-1)</span>. A little rearrangement gives the condition <span class="math inline">p
&lt; B K - 1</span>.</p>
<p>We are safe again as soon as <span class="math inline">p &lt; B-1</span>: all the relevant values are
going to be computed local to the current block in the forward phase.</p>
<p>To make this work, we need to synchronise the blocks somehow. Here I
am going to simply store a value in global memory that records the
overall progress, i.e., up to what position the values are known. Each
thread will also know up to what position its block’s shared buffer is
correct, and if a still-unknown value is needed, we’ll have the block
spin until that value is available.</p>
<p>The backward phase now looks like:</p>

<p>With 8 blocks of size 256, this does 942K/s. Getting better!</p>
<h2 id="speculating-in-the-forward-phase">Speculating in the Forward Phase</h2>
<p>As observed by Grossman, the speed of the calculation is ultimately
limited by how quickly each block can get through its critical
segment, that is, the part where it computes the MEX. While this is
happening, all other blocks are likely waiting for it to finish. Our
priority now should be to make that forward phase as fast as possible.</p>
<p>Once we’ve completed the backwards phase, we can have each thread
speculate on what its MEX will be given the past values it’s seen so
far. This can be done simultaneously over all threads. Then, we can
use these speculative values to mark the MEX arrays, and recalculate
the MEXes (again simultaneously).<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-11" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-11" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">This is so obviously the right
thing to do that it’s embarrassing I didn’t do it to begin with.<br />
<br />
</span></span>
Here’s the trick: if we get the <em>same</em> answer as the first round of
MEXes, then in fact this is the right answer. If our blocks are of
size 256, we’ve replaced 256 sequential MEX calculations and 256
forward broadcasts with 2 parallel MEX calculations and 51 backwards
lookups (the number of rare positions below 256).</p>
<p>If we <em>don’t</em> get the same answer, we simply repeat the process. The
values get monotonically more correct from left to right after each
round, and so this is guaranteed to reach a fixed point. In principle
we could get very unlucky, but most of the time it only takes two or
three rounds.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-12" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-12" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">In a quick test, the chance of a block being done after
<span class="math inline">n</span> rounds was 0%, 10%, 62%, 84%, 96%, 99%.<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p>Because the values within the block are changing, we have to store a
second <code>mex_array</code> for these final values so that it can be easily
reset between rounds.</p>

<p>This modest change gets us 3.6M positions per second, a 4×
improvement. Wow!</p>
<p>Following this reasoning a bit further, it seems reasonable to try and
avoid doing the entire loop over the <code>LAST_RARES</code>, only looping over
the suffix of the values that are still unconfirmed. Unfortunately,
the extra bookkeeping involved makes this slightly slower than just
doing the whole loop every time.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-13" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-13" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">It is extremely demoralising when

<h2 id="synchronising-properly">Synchronising Properly</h2>
<p>This code works on my machine and with these particular parameters,
but it possibly shouldn’t. The CUDA programming model makes no
guarantees about when blocks get run in relation to each other, so the
strategy I’ve used here of synchronising via a global variable could
deadlock if for some reason one of the blocks never gets scheduled.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell there are three official methods for
synchronising across different blocks, even those that are part of the
same kernel:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wait for all blocks to run to completion then launch a new
computation.</li>
<li>Use <code>cuda::barrier&lt;cuda::thread_scope_device&gt;</code>.</li>
<li>Use the <code>grid.sync()</code> method in the Cooperative Groups library.</li>
</ul>
<p>It would be nice to implement things “properly” and use one of these
methods. The one that fits best is to use <code>cuda::barrier</code>.
Unfortunately, this ends up significantly slower than the cheating
method I’m using now, so I’ll keep that in my back pocket in case
deadlocks become an actual issue. I haven’t tracked down exactly why
this slowdown occurs.</p>
<h2 id="the-state-of-play">The State of Play</h2>
<p>Everything described above is available at
<a href="https://github.com/mvr/officers" class="uri">https://github.com/mvr/officers</a>. At the time of writing it
calculates values at 3.6M/s on my (<a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/autonomous-machines/embedded-systems/jetson-orin/nano-super-developer-kit/">dinky little</a>) machine. This is
pathetic: Grossman’s code gets 5M/s on 8 (CPU) threads, and I’m only
getting 3.6M/s on vastly more (GPU) threads. We should be able to do
better. Clock speed goes some of the way (but not all the way!) to
explaining the speed difference: Grossman was using a 2.66GHz CPU
whereas this GPU runs at 900MHz. The <code>__ffs</code> intrinsic used for
calculating the MEX is also <a href="https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-best-practices-guide/index.html#arithmetic-instructions">more expensive</a> than you would expect,
with a SM not even able to calculate an entire warp’s worth per cycle.</p>
<p>We’ll need a better strategy. The next idea, and what I’ll leave for
next time, is to scale up speculation to the level of entire blocks,
allowing each block to compute a speculative set of values based on
unconfirmed previous ones. If those unconfirmed previous values turn
out to be correct, the speculative values themselves are also correct.</p>
<p>At worst this would be as fast as the single-block version, because
the earliest unconfirmed block never has to actually do any
speculation. Again, it will have to be determined empirically how many
rounds of speculation each block needs on average before all mistakes
are fixed.</p>
<p>PS. My personal suspicion is that Officers is periodic but with a
pre-period so long that humans will never live to find out what it is.
This is more about the journey than the destination.</p>

<p>Conduits are a central piece of technology in Conway’s Game of Life,
especially when engineering new pieces of stable circuitry. A conduit
moves an active pattern (like a <a href="https://conwaylife.com/wiki/Herschel">Herschel</a> or <a href="https://conwaylife.com/wiki/B-heptomino">B-heptomino</a>) from one
location to another by allowing it to react with a collection of
stable catalysts. Along the way, it may release some gliders, produce
additional active patterns or perform some other useful interaction,
and so new pieces of machinery can be constructed by chaining conduits
together.</p>
<p>As one very famous example we have the <a href="https://conwaylife.com/wiki/Fx77">Fx77</a> conduit discovered by
Dave Buckingham, which moves a Herschel forwards in 77 generations,
also flipping it.</p>

<p>Many software tools have been written to search for new conduits:
<a href="https://github.com/conwaylife/ptbsearch"><code>ptbsearch</code></a> by Paul Callahan, <a href="https://github.com/dvgrn/b3s23life/tree/main/catgl">Catalyst</a> by Gabriel Nivasch, <code>catgl</code> by
Dave Greene, <a href="https://github.com/simsim314/CatForce">CatForce</a> by Michael Simkin and <a href="https://github.com/nicobrownmath/LocalForce">LocalForce</a> by Nico Brown,
to name a few. Typically these tools are handed an active pattern and
a collection of catalysts, and spit out all placements of catalysts
that interact with the active pattern and recover. At this point,
hundreds of conduits are known, converting to and from various active
patterns. But the more the merrier!</p>
<p>I’ve been working on yet another search tool, called <a href="https://github.com/mvr/lightcone">Lightcone</a>.
Lightcone is pretty speedy: it can find apg’s <a href="" title="https://conwaylife.com/wiki/Spartan_G-to-W-to-H">Spartan G-to-W</a> on
<a href="https://github.com/mvr/lightcone/blob/master/tests/thessalonic.toml">this</a> input file in just a couple of seconds. In this post I’ll
explain some of the tricks it uses to cut down the search time.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Clicking on the patterns in this post will copy them to the clipboard
so you can paste them into Golly. I’m using Chris Rowett’s
<a href="https://github.com/rowett/lifeviewer">LifeViewer</a> to display the
patterns.</p>
<h2 id="brute-force-and-just-in-time">Brute Force and Just-in-time</h2>
<p>To search for conduits, an obvious method is brute force: simply test
each possible arrangement of catalysts and check whether all the
catalysts recover. This is the approach taken by the original version
of CatForce by Michael Simkin, hence the name.</p>
<p>Original CatForce does cut down on the search space slightly by first
calculating the reaction envelope of the input pattern and making sure
that at least one catalyst lies in that envelope. After that, though,
all possible placements for the other catalysts are tried (within
user-specified bounds). This is the case even if the other catalysts
do not interact with the pattern at all! Original CatForce applies
most of its filtering <em>after</em> a candidate configuration has already
been run all the way through.</p>
<p>For a small number of catalysts, say 1 to 3, this strategy can run to
completion in a reasonable amount of time. And if many of the
catalysts are expected to be transparent then the brute force approach
is not too wasteful, because the configurations have to be run to
completion to determine whether these transparent catalysts recover
(although testing non-interacting placements is still pointless). One
spectacular example is this Herschel-to-MWSS reaction found by Tanner
Jacobi.</p>

<p>For searches involving non-transparent catalysts we can do much
better. CatForce treats the first catalyst specially to ensure that it
will interact with the active region. But we can generalise that idea
to every subsequent catalyst placement too. Rather than trying every
possible placement, just in case, throughout the search we watch the
active pattern evolve and only try catalyst placements that will
interact with it in the next generation. It is also easy to track the
history of the pattern, and avoid any placement that would have
interacted on some earlier generation. This just-in-time placement is
used by all the other search tools I am aware of, including my
“Symmetric” fork of CatForce.</p>
<p>On its own this is a huge improvement, because the reaction envelope
can vary a lot after just a single catalyst placement.</p>

<p>The overall structure of the search is then a depth-first search over
catalyst positions. At each node of the search tree, we either place a
catalyst which interacts on the current generation, or advance to the
next generation.</p>
<h2 id="contacts-and-approaches">Contacts and Approaches</h2>
<p>The first new idea, which functions independently of the others, is to
only try placements where the active pattern is in the right shape for
the catalysis to succeed. Consider the ordinary eater:</p>

<p>The vast majority of successful interactions with the head of the
eater begin with the birth of exactly those two marked cells, cells
that wouldn’t otherwise be born if not for the eater. I have been
calling such perturbed cells the <em>contact point</em> of the catalyst.
These contact points are easy to calculate in a pre-processing step.</p>
<p>If the initial interaction does not match, it is overwhelmingly likely
that the catalyst is going to explode rather than recovering, so
knowing the contact points lets us cut down the number of placements
to check. Looking at the upper contact cell for the eater, a birth is
caused when it gains exactly two active neighbours. When iterating
through the reaction envelope, we only need to consider offsets for
the eater that put that contact cell next to exactly two active cells.</p>
<p>In addition to checking the contact point, we can look at more of the
active pattern. The following (contrived) situation causes the correct
births, but is also overwhelmingly likely to not work because the
active pattern has the wrong shape.</p>

<p>The required shape of active cells I have been calling the <em>approach</em>.
In Lightcone, I check that the approach is correct by extracting a 5x5
“signature” around each possible contact point in the active pattern,
and comparing it to the precomputed 5x5 signature around the contact
point in the catalyst. (This is a bit faster than dealing with the
entire state.) For the eater, the approach looks like:</p>

<p>There is a trade-off to this strategy, of course. We are deliberately
excluding unusual interactions that begin in some other way. Each
individual unusual interaction has a very small chance of working, but
collectively we might be cutting out a lot of interesting results.
Checking approaches really does make a huge difference to performance,
so the reader will have to decide whether losing out on these
serendipitous results is worth it.</p>
<h2 id="problems-and-their-lightcones">Problems and their Lightcones</h2>
<p>If a non-transparent catalyst is destroyed, it is unlikely to reform
by chance. For this reason, most search tools allow the user to
specify <em>required</em> cells of the catalyst, which are not allowed to
have their state flipped at any point. For the eater, this might be
all the marked cells in:</p>

<p>This includes most of the cells in a halo around the catalyst; if a
neighbouring cell on the left side is flipped on, the eater is
probably in the process of exploding.</p>
<p>If after advancing the overall state we find that one of these
required cells has its state flipped, we can drop that branch of the
search: it is safe to assume that the catalyst will never recover.</p>
<p>A required cell failing is an example of what I call a <em>problem</em> that
may occur with a given configuration. There are a handful of other
problems that Lightcone can currently test for, depending on the input
parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>Required cells failing, as above.</li>
<li>A filter for a particular state not being matched. For example, you
may want to make sure that a glider escapes from a reaction.</li>
<li>A catalyst failing to recover within a specified time.</li>
<li>An overall time limit being reached without all catalysts recovered.</li>
<li>An overall time limit being reached without any catalysts
interacting at all.</li>
<li>A transparent catalyst not actually acting transparently. (This is
most common with blocks, and is intended to avoid “boring” results.)</li>
<li>A stationary piece of junk surviving for too long.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any time one of these problems occurs, we can safely drop that branch
of the search. A key property of these problems is that they are
“monotonic”, in the sense that no placement that interacts on a later
generation can possibly cause the problem to be avoided.</p>
<p>Here is the next key idea. Rather than waiting until a problem occurs
to react to it, at each node of the search tree we run a lookahead
(with no further catalyst placements) to find the next problem that
will occur. Once its time and location is known, this is a strong
constraint on any possible solution. There <em>must</em> be at least one
additional catalyst placement at a time and location that has a chance
of averting the problem. That is, there must be at least one catalyst
placement that has its contact point within the past lightcone of the
problem, and so we can save time by restricting our attention to
finding this catalyst placement first.</p>
<p>For example, consider the following interaction, with the required
cells of the eater marked. After 36 generations we encounter a
problem: one of the required cells of the eater has flipped.</p>

<p>This search strategy can cause placements to be tested
<em>non-chronologically</em>, because after solving a problem that occurs in
one part of the state, we may free ourselves to go back and interact
with some other part of the state. This non-chronological placement
appears to be fairly rare in practice.</p>

<p>The eater is placed in order to save the lower block, but once that is
done, Lightcone is able to rewind and place the upper block.</p>
<p>So much for the past lightcone of a problem. There is another place
where we can use lightspeed considerations to our advantage. As it
stands, after we place a catalyst, we begin anew and test all
locations within the envelope of the active pattern for whether they
are suitable for a catalyst placement. But we don’t need to throw away
all the work we’ve already done: the new active reaction can only be
different from the previous one within the future lightcone of the
placement we just made. Outside that lightcone, the determinations we
made for whether a placement is valid can be reused.</p>

<p>Here I follow Adam P. Goucher’s (unimplemented) idea for Silk to use a
Bloom filter to quickly test whether the reaction has been seen
previously. A Bloom filter lets us store the hashes of many millions
of states using relatively little memory. The trade-off is a small
risk of false positives, once too many hashes have been added to the
filter. Again following a suggestion by apg, the filter is reset to
empty once the chance of false positives reaches an intolerable level.</p>
<p>The criteria for when the active pattern is tested against the Bloom
filter were arrived at through trial and error. Right now, the pattern
is tested and added to the filter when</p>
<ul>
<li>all non-transparent catalysts are present,</li>
<li>at least two generations have passed since the most recent catalyst
was placed, and</li>
<li>the population of the active pattern is at least 12.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, there is another balance to be struck here. We want to
catch as many repeated reactions as possible, but not accidentally
consider some dying sparks as a repeated reaction if they were
actually arrived at by different means.</p>
<h2 id="future-ideas">Future Ideas</h2>
<p>Lightcone is certainly not the last word in conduit searching. It’s
much smarter than a brute force search, but still makes choices that
are obviously silly to the human eye. I’d love to hear ideas on any of
the following topics:</p>
<h3 id="catalyst-welding">Catalyst Welding</h3>
<p>Lightcone only tries placing complete catalysts, and excludes any
placement that will cause two catalysts to interact. This inevitably
misses some solutions that involve non-trivial welds to pack catalysts
slightly closer together than otherwise possible. One unsatisfying
solution is for the user to provide pre-welded catalyst pairs as
input, but in an ideal world Lightcone would do this systematically
and automatically.</p>
<p>This will likely mean testing all interacting offsets of one catalyst
against another, and testing whether a weld is possible. Presumably a
SAT solver could make short work of this.</p>
<p>In a branch, I’ve had a go at implementing this, but the performance
hit is unreasonably high (at least with the method I’m using
currently).</p>
<h3 id="avoiding-hopeless-placements">Avoiding Hopeless Placements</h3>
<p>Currently, some time is spent on placements where the recovery
sequence of one catalyst leads to a cascade of interactions with
additional catalysts. For example, the following completely hopeless
chain of block reactions which takes 8 generations to finally fail:</p>

<p>It would be nice if these could be avoided without hardcoding those
nearby block placements to be forbidden. It’s unclear to me what the
correct heuristic is here. We have to be careful: not all tightly
packed catalysts are useless. The similarly close eater in the
following example is necessary for the block to survive.</p>

<p>Lightcone always tackles the chronologically earliest <em>problem</em> that
occurs with the current configuration. In some situations this leads
to poor performance, especially when the active region splits into two
separated pieces.</p>

<p>A problem in the left region may be solved, revealing a problem in the
right region, and vice versa. This alternation causes a combinatorial
blowup in the time it takes to make progress on either side. In theory
it should be possible to choose which problem to focus on more
intelligently, but doing so naively causes even bigger issues:
Lightcone might go down a rabbithole solving problems on the left,
when it’s easy to show that the problem on the right is unsolvable.</p>
<p>This may be an opportunity for some parallelism: if there are multiple
problems that are lightcone separated, we could attempt to resolve
them in different threads.</p>

    <published>September 22, 2022</published>
    <updated>2022-09-22T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Code available on <a href="https://github.com/mvr/at">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>For a little while I have been working on this port of <a href="https://www-fourier.ujf-grenoble.fr/~sergerar/Kenzo/">Kenzo</a> from
Common Lisp to Haskell. Kenzo is a collection of algorithms for
explicit constructions on simplicial sets: the
<a href="https://github.com/mvr/at/blob/master/README.md"><code>README</code></a> in the
repository gives a list of what’s implemented and what should be
possible. The algorithms and implementations in Kenzo were created by
Francis Sergeraert, Julio Rubio Garcia, Xavier Dousson, Ana Romero and
many collaborators.</p>
<p>My goal was to implement just enough to compute <span class="math inline">\pi_4 S^3</span>,
and I reached it today.</p>
<pre><code>...
&gt; let x = totalSpace s3 (Wbar kz1) fibration
&gt; putStrLn $ &quot;π₄ S³ is: &quot; ++ show (homology x !! 4)
π₄ S³ is: ℤ/2</code></pre>
<p>A fun capability it picked up along the way is calculating the
homology of Eilenberg-MacLane spaces <span class="math inline">K(ℤ/m,n)</span>, for example, here is
<span class="math inline">K(ℤ/3,2)</span>.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-0" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-0" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">This makes my laptop get hot pretty quickly.<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<pre><code>&gt; homology (Wbar (WbarDiscrete (Zmod 3)))
[ℤ,0,ℤ/3,0,ℤ/3,0,ℤ/(3^2),ℤ/3,ℤ/3,ℤ/3,ℤ/3 ⊕ ℤ/3,^C</code></pre>
<p>I have a lot of ideas for improvements and additional features if
anybody is interested in joining in, so <mark>please email me if that’s
you or you know a student for whom this would make a good project</mark>.
For example, adding the construction of loop spaces and their homology
would be nice, as would homotopy pushouts in general.</p>
<p>On the implementation side, I have not spent any time optimising the
code and there are some obvious places to start, like using a proper
integer matrix library instead of a homemade one. These sorts of
optimisations would also make a good project for an undergraduate,
with not much mathematical background required.</p>
<p>Below, I’ve copy-pasted a quick introduction I wrote to the ideas
behind Kenzo.</p>
<h2 id="central-concepts-of-kenzo">Central Concepts of Kenzo</h2>
<p>A <em>simplicial set</em> <span class="math inline">X</span> is described in code by some abstract type <code>a</code>,
containing whatever data is required to specify <span class="math inline">X</span>, and a type
<code>GeomSimplex a</code>, whose elements correspond to non-degenerate
simplices; in Kenzo these are referred to as ‘geometric simplices’.
Like Kenzo we also allow a predicate on <code>GeomSimplex a</code> specifying
when an element actually describes a geometric simplex and when it is
spurious.</p>
<p>An actual simplex of <span class="math inline">X</span> is a geometric simplex together with a
‘formal degeneracy operator’, which is a list of degeneracy operators
in a normal form. Face maps are implemented as functions from
geometric simplices to (possibly degenerate) simplices, and the
extension of these face maps to all simplices is forced by the
simplicial identities.</p>
<p>A simplicial set is <em>of finite type</em> if there is a finite number of
geometric simplices for each dimension, and there is a function giving
a list of these simplices for any dimension <span class="math inline">n</span>. It is not required
that there are finitely many geometric simplices overall.</p>
<p>The <em>normalised chain complex</em> <span class="math inline">N(X)</span> of <span class="math inline">X</span> has each <span class="math inline">N(X)_n</span> given
by the free abelian group on the set of nondegenerate <span class="math inline">n</span>-simplices of
<span class="math inline">X</span>, with the boundary of a simplex calculated similar to usual (the
alternating sum of face maps), but ignoring any degenerate faces.</p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">C(X)</span> is the ordinary chain complex of simplicial chains of <span class="math inline">X</span>,
the quotient map <span class="math inline">C(X) \to N(X)</span> is a quasi-isomorphism, and so if <span class="math inline">X</span>
is of finite type, then the homology of <span class="math inline">X</span> can be computed via
<span class="math inline">N(X)</span>.</p>
<p>But many unavoidable simplicial sets (like <span class="math inline">K(ℤ,n)</span> and loop spaces
<span class="math inline">ΩX</span>) are not of finite type, and so we need some other way to
calculate their homology. This is where ‘effective homology’ comes in.</p>
<p>A <em>reduction</em> between chain complexes <span class="math inline">C</span> and <span class="math inline">D</span> is a strong
deformation retract of chain complexes. The data of a reduction
unwinds to a triple (<span class="math inline">f : C \to D</span>, <span class="math inline">g : D \to C</span>, <span class="math inline">h : C \to C</span>) where
<span class="math inline">f</span> and <span class="math inline">g</span> are degree 0, the homotopy operator <span class="math inline">h</span> is degree 1, and
certain equations involving these hold. A <em>(strong chain)
equivalence</em> between two chain complexes <span class="math inline">C</span> and <span class="math inline">D</span> is a span of
reductions <span class="math inline">l : E \to C</span> and <span class="math inline">r : E \to D</span>.</p>
<p>An <em>effective homology structure</em> on <span class="math inline">C</span> is an equivalence between <span class="math inline">C</span>
and a chain complex <span class="math inline">F</span> of finite type.</p>
<p>A <em>simplicial set with effective homology</em> is a simplicial set <span class="math inline">X</span>
equipped with an effective homology structure on <span class="math inline">N(X)</span>.</p>
<p>The point of Kenzo is that although constructions on simplicial sets
sometimes do not preserve levelwise finiteness, they <em>do</em> extend to
effective homology structures. And so if we begin with a finite
simplicial complex and perform some constructions using it, then we
can often compute the homology of the result even if the actual
simplicial sets are now far too complicated to get a handle on.</p>]]></summary>
