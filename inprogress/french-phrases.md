Using French phrases in English prose always adds a certain _je ne
sais quoi_ (je ne say kwa), and is an extremely efficient way to let
everyone know you're a tosser.

An _hors d'oeuvre_ (or derve), literally "outside the work", is just
an appetizer.

The phrase _coup d'etat_ (koo day tah) is a little different in that a
francophobic English-speaker has speaker has no good alternative:
neither "overthrow of government" or "military uprising" captures the
right idea.

_a la mode_ to an American means "with ice cream".

_avant garde_ (avon gard), literally "fore guard"

_haute couture_

_tête-à-tête_ (tet a tet), literally "head-to-head"

_bête noire_

_bon mot_

_carte blanche_

_cordon bleu_

_fait accompli_

_nom de guerre_
