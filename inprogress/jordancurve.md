Pick up a pen and draw some kind of squiggly loop so that you end where you start and don't cross your own path. The most obvious thing you could say about your picture is that the page has been split into two disjoint regions; the part inside your curve and the part outside. This assertion is known as the _Jordan curve theorem_. Not only is it something that needs to be proven, but a formal proof was only given 100 years ago!
