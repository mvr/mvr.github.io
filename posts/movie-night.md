For years now I've been watching a movie in-person with friends every
weekend that it is possible. The movie selection system is perfect,
crystalline, sacred, with no downsides or vulnerabilities.

1. The nominator is the person who was previously nominator the
   longest ago.
2. They choose two movies that haven't been nominated before.
3. Everybody else votes. If the vote is a tie, the nominator breaks
   the vote. 

Here's what we've watched so far^[The losing movies from some of the
early, legendary movie nights have been lost to time.], together with
ratings using the simplest possible system.^[And take these ratings
with a grain of salt, I like more of the movies that I see than the
average person.] I'll add to this over time. Sometimes the pair of
nominations has a theme, often not.
