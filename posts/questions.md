These answers can be found just by Googling, but it's nice to have a
record of things I've wondered about.

* __Why do jetskis spit that jet of water vertically?__

  This is apparently just for visibility, there is a little pipe
  attached to the outlet that faces upward. A lot of people plug it so
  they don't spray passengers or nearby people.

* __Why is orange juice usually from concentrate?__

  Easier to package and transport.

* __Why do American school buses look more or less identical?__

  Road rules are different around school busses; in particular, the
  stop sign that pops out from the side stops traffic in both
  directions. For this reason it is important that they are easily
  identifiable. The yellow is said to be more eye-catching in
  peripheral vision than other colours.

* __What are blackboards made of?__

  These days, porcelain enamel on a steel base. They are often green
  rather than black, the thinking being that the green paint reduces
  glare compared to black.

* __What are the square, Asian-looking stamps sometimes present on the
  title page of old books?__

  Those are 'seals', signatures in stamp form. The books I'm thinking
  of must have once been owned by someone who had their own seal.

* __What is the connection between barbers and red/white striped
  poles?__

  One of the services that medieval "barber-surgeons" would perform
  was blood-letting. The pole represents the staff that patients would
  grip to make their veins pop, and the red and white colouring
  represents the bloody bandages that would be hung outside the shop
  to dry.

* __Why do signs give the maximum fine for disobeying them? Wouldn't a
  minimum be more persuasive?__

  Typically people are given the maximum penalty, so the value shown
  is the fine that any would-be lawbreakers should expect. However, it
  is better for judges to be able to use discretion on exactly what
  fine is imposed in specific situations.

* __Why do so many recipe websites have long boring stories before the
  recipes?__

  Some people like to waffle, but a big reason is ad revenue and
  SEO. Long and detailed text causes visitors to spend more time on
  your site, and gives more opportunities to include relevant search
  keywords.

* __Were people just killed by acute appendicitis before modern
  surgery?__

  Yes.

* __Why are bay leaves typically not ground up like other herbs?__

  The flavour of bay leaves is overpoweringly strong when ground up,
  even in very small amounts.

* __What is the cause of the 'fingernails on a blackboard' response?__

  The cause is currently unknown, but there are some theories.

  One hypothesis is that the sound is similar to the alarm call of
  some monkeys and the instinct to cringe dates back to early human
  evolution. Another is that the sound is "the ultimate dissonance",
  and is unpleasant for the same reason that dissonant music is
  unpleasant.

  Interestingly, tests showed that it is the middle frequencies
  (2000Hz to 4000Hz) that cause the instinctive reaction, not the high
  frequencies as one might expect.
