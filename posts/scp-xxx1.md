**Item #:** SCP-XXX1

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-XXX1 is currently uncontained.

Civilian research into the effect of SCP-XXX1 is to be monitored and,
if necessary, suppressed. To mitigate the effect of SCP-XXX1 on the
general public, motivational fitness memes such as "to get one's
second wind", and "pushing through the pain" are to be disseminated
through popular exercise resources. Additional examples can be found
in Addendum-XX.

Foundation personnel who experience the effect of SCP-XXX1 are to move
away from the area that the attack began if practical, and log the
occurrence.

**Description:** SCP-XXX1 is a phenomenon that affects muscle tissue
that is undergoing repetitive motion. After sustained, rhythmic motion
of around 5 to 10 minutes, small punctures in the interior of the
affected tissue will appear and blood will be drained from the
wound. These lesions typically occur near the center of mass of the
tissue.

The effect ends if the tissue is moved a sufficiently far from the
area where the drainage began. In humans, the effect of SCP-XXX1 is
experienced as a sharp pain in the torso, most often under the lower
edge of the ribcage. In the rare case that a lesion occurs nearby to
the blood vessels supplying the heart itself, cardiac arrest leading
to death can occur. This occurs more frequently in those in middle age
or older.

SCP-XXX1 attacks have been noted to occur more often in wilderness
areas, particularly around bodies of fresh water.

<!-- Idea: -->
<!-- ----- -->

<!-- When people get a stitch while running, it's some extradimensional bug -->
<!-- nibbling at their side. Let's say these things are attracted to -->
<!-- movement, which is why running sets them off. -->

<!-- Could add something like, if you don't keep running (perhaps if you -->
<!-- don't get far enough away from where the stitch first started) then it -->
<!-- eats some tiny chunk of your insides. And if you're very unlucky, that -->
<!-- chunk is some important piece of your heart, and you die of a heart -->
<!-- attack (as people exercising sometimes do). -->


<!-- Luckily, in the real world we're not sure what causes stitches, which -->
<!-- adds nicely to the mystery! Could even say something like "research -->
<!-- into the cause of the pain is to be interrupted" and "folk -->
<!-- explanations are to be kept vague", in the containment procedures. -->

<!-- Should also say what Foundation personnel are supposed to do when they -->
<!-- get a stitch. -->

<!-- Is it more compelling if the process is blood sucking rather than biting? -->
