I am one of those losers who has long been subscribed to the daily
[arXiv digest]. I didn't sign up for every single category, just the
following: cs.LO, cs.MS, cs.PL, cs.SC, math.AT, math.CT, math.LO.^[Am
I missing any good ones?]

[arXiv digest]: https://info.arxiv.org/help/subscribe.html

I mostly scroll through the list and occasionally pick out a couple of
papers that seem like they might be my speed. I thought it might be
interesting to keep a record of the things that caught my eye. Taste
in computer science and mathematics is of course intensely personal,
and so this list may only be of interest to me.

TODO: write script to get metadata and autoformat. Or use bibfile and pandoc?
